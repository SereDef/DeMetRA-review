Abstract: Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have been associated with an increased risk of delayed neurodevelopment in children as well as differential newborn DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the biological mechanisms connecting PTE and PAE, DNAm, and neurodevelopment are largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether differential DNAm mediates the association between PTE and PAE and neurodevelopment at 6 (N = 112) and 24 months (N = 184) in children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. PTE and PAE were assessed antenatally using urine cotinine measurements and the ASSIST questionnaire, respectively. Cord blood DNAm was measured using the EPIC and 450 K BeadChips. Neurodevelopment (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behavior, socioemotional) was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We constructed methylation risk scores (MRS) for PTE and PAE and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) with these MRS as mediators. Next, we conducted a high-dimensional mediation analysis to identify individual CpG sites as potential mediators, followed by a CMA to estimate the average causal mediation effects (ACME) and total effect (TE). PTE and PAE were associated with neurodevelopment at 6 but not at 24 months. PTE MRS reached a prediction accuracy (R2) of 0.23 but did not significantly mediate the association between PTE and neurodevelopment. PAE MRS was not predictive of PAE (R2 = 0.006). For PTE, 31 CpG sites and eight CpG sites were identified as significant mediators (ACME and TE P < 0.05) for the cognitive and motor domains at 6 months, respectively. For PAE, 16 CpG sites and 1 CpG site were significant mediators for the motor and adaptive behavior domains at 6 months, respectively. Several of the associated genes, including MAD1L1, CAMTA1, and ALDH1A2 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting that differential DNAm may partly explain the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTE and PAE and child neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Methylation of host and viral genes is promising for triage of women with high-risk human papillomavirus infections (hrHPV). Using a population-based sample of hrHPV positive women with cervical biopsies within 12 months after cervical screening, the clinical value of the S5 methylation classifier (S5), HPV genotyping and cytology were compared as potential triage tests, for outcomes of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or greater (CIN3+), CIN2+ and CIN2, and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. S5 scores increased with histopathology severity (Ptrend <.001). For CIN3+, the AUC was 0.780 suggesting S5 provides good discrimination between <CIN3 and CIN3+. AUCs were significant for all pairwise comparisons of <CIN2, CIN2 and CIN3+ (P <.001). The positive predictive value (PPV) of HPV16/18 genotyping for women with any abnormal cytology was greater than S5 (25.36% vs 20.87%, P =.005) for CIN3+, while sensitivity was substantially greater for S5 (83.33% vs 59.28%, P <.001). Restricting to women with abnormal cytology, but excluding those with high-grade cytology, both S5 and HPV16/18 provided CIN3+ PPVs high enough to recommend colposcopy. Triage with S5 also appeared useful for hrHPV positive women negative for HPV16/18 (CIN3+ PPV: 7.33%, sensitivity: 57.52%). S5 provided increased sensitivity for CIN3+ compared to HPV16/18 genotyping for hrHPV positive women, overall and when restricted to women with abnormal cytology, suggesting S5 may improve colposcopy referral. S5 also has the ability to distinguish between <CIN2, CIN2 and CIN3+, a finding of importance for managing CIN2, given the complexity and uncertainty associated with this diagnosis.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aimed to undertake a multidisciplinary characterization of the phenotype associated with SOX11 variants. Methods: Individuals with protein altering variants in SOX11 were identified through exome and genome sequencing and international data sharing. Deep clinical phenotyping was undertaken by referring clinicians. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC array. The expression pattern of SOX11 in developing human brain was defined using RNAscope. Results: We reported 38 new patients with SOX11 variants. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed as a feature of SOX11 syndrome. A distinctive pattern of blood DNA methylation was identified in SOX11 syndrome, separating SOX11 syndrome from other BAFopathies. Conclusion: SOX11 syndrome is a distinct clinical entity with characteristic clinical features and episignature differentiating it from BAFopathies.

Abstract: Background: Rapid postnatal growth may result from exposure in utero or early life to adverse conditions and has been associated with diseases later in life and, in particular, with childhood obesity. DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming. Methods: Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings. Results: Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e−05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e−07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e−04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.

Abstract: Genetic variation may impact on local DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, information about allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) within disease-related loci has been proposed to be useful for the interpretation of GWAS results. To explore mechanisms that may underlie associations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia risk CLU gene and verbal memory, one of the most affected cognitive domains in both conditions, we studied DNA methylation in a region between AD-associated SNPs rs9331888 and rs9331896 in 72 healthy individuals and 73 schizophrenia patients. Using single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing we assessed the haplotype-dependent ASM in this region. We then investigated whether its methylation could influence episodic verbal memory measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in these two cohorts. The region showed a complex methylation pattern, which was similar in healthy and schizophrenia individuals and unrelated to haplotypes. The pattern predicted memory scores in controls. The results suggest that epigenetic modifications within the CLU locus may play a role in memory variation, independent of ASM.

Abstract: As genetic and environmental influences on schizophrenia might converge on DNA methylation (DNAm) within loci which are both associated with the disease and implicated in response to environmental stress, we examined whether DNAm within CYP17A1, a hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis gene which is situated within the schizophrenia risk locus 10q24.32, would mediate genetic and environmental effects on stress-related schizophrenia symptoms. DNAm within an exonic–intronic fragment of CYP17A1 was assessed in the blood of 66 schizophrenia patients and 63 controls using single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, the VNTR polymorphism of the AS3MT gene, a plausible causal variant within the 10q24.32 locus, was genotyped in extended patient and control samples (n = 700). The effects of local haplotype, VNTR and a polyenviromic risk score (PERS) on DNAm, episodic verbal memory, executive functions, depression, and suicidality of patients were assessed. Haplotype and PERS differentially influenced DNAm at four variably methylated sites identified within the fragment, with stochastic, additive, and allele-specific effects being found. An allele-specific DNAm at CpG-SNP rs3781286 mediated the relationship between the local haplotype and verbal fluency. Our findings do not confirm that the interrogated DNA fragment is a place where genetic and environmental risk factors converge to influence schizophrenia symptoms through DNAm.

Abstract: Conventional genetic testing of individuals with neurodevelopmental presentations and congenital anomalies (ND/CAs), i.e., the analysis of sequence and copy number variants, leaves a substantial proportion of them unexplained. Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNA methylation defects at a single locus (epi-variants), while others can exhibit syndrome-specific DNA methylation changes across multiple loci (epi-signatures). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unresolved ND/CAs. We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model in resolving 67 individuals with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases and highlights the potential value of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assessment of ND/CAs.

Here, we report a patient with features of Kabuki syndrome who carries two rare heterozygous variants in KMT2D: c.12935C>T, p.(Ser4312Phe) and c.15785-10T>G. The clinical significance of these variants were discordantly interpreted by different diagnostic laboratories. Parental testing showed that the missense variant was inherited from the father with a mild Kabuki phenotype and the intronic variant from the mother with mosaic status. Through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood, we confirmed that the proband exhibited a previously described episignature of Kabuki syndrome. Parental samples had normal DNA methylation profiles, thus ruling out the involvement of the paternally inherited missense variant. RNA analysis revealed that the intronic change resulted in exon 49 skipping and frameshift, thereby providing a molecular diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome. This study demonstrates the utility of epigenomic and RNA analyses in resolving ambiguous clinical cases. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Pediatric developmental syndromes present with systemic, complex, and often overlapping clinical features that are not infrequently a consequence of Mendelian inheritance of mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation, establishment of histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling (the “epigenetic machinery”). The mechanistic cross-talk between histone modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures, we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical and molecular features associated with the disruption of the epigenetic machinery.

Abstract: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a high risk of developing chronic diseases and decreased life expectancy, but no ACE epigenetic biomarkers have been identified until now. The latter may result from the interaction of multiple factors such as age, sex, degree of adversity, and lack of transcriptional effects of DNA methylation changes. We hypothesize that DNA methylation changes are related to childhood adversity levels and current age, and these markers evolve as aging proceeds. Two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, regarding ACE, were selected (GSE72680 and GSE70603), considering raw- and meta-data availability, including validated ACE index (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) score). For DNA methylation, analyzed probes were restricted to those laying within promoters and first exons, and samples were grouped by CTQ scores terciles, to compare highly (ACE) with non-abused (control) cases. Comparison of control and ACE methylome profile did not retrieve differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) after correcting by false discovery rate < 0.05, and this was also observed when samples were separated by sex. In contrast, grouping by decade age ranges (i.e., the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) showed a progressive increase in the number of DMCs and the intensity of changes, mainly related with hypomethylation. Comparison with transcriptome data for ACE subjects in the 40s, and 50s showed a similar age-dependent effect. This study provides evidence that epigenetic markers of ACE are age-dependent, but not defined in the long term. These differences among early, middle, and late adulthood epigenomic profiles suggest a window for interventions aimed to prevent the detrimental effects of ACE.

Abstract: Pathogenic variants in KANSL1 and 17q21.31 microdeletions are causative of Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS), a neurodevelopmental syndrome with characteristic facial dysmorphia. Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes have identifiable patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) change: DNAm signatures or episignatures. Given the role of KANSL1 in histone acetylation, we tested whether variants underlying KdVS are associated with a DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 13 individuals with KANSL1 variants, four individuals with 17q21.31 microdeletions, and 21 typically developing individuals, using Illumina’s Infinium EPIC array. In this study, we identified a robust DNAm signature of 456 significant CpG sites in 8 individuals with KdVS, a pattern independently validated in an additional 7 individuals with KdVS. We also demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the signature and classify two KANSL1 VUS as well as four variants in individuals with atypical clinical presentation. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific DNAm changes in fibroblast cells from individuals with KdVS. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the epigenetic landscape related to KdVS and aid in the diagnosis and classification of variants in this structurally complex genomic region.

Abstract: Exposure in utero to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is associated with maladaptive health outcomes. Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n = 749) and 15 (n = 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158, p = 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095, p = 0.06) across all participants. The PM10 findings were driven by the age 15 subset where an interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a -0.024 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.043, -0.005, p = 0.012). Findings were robust to adjustment for PM exposure at ages 1 and 3. In utero PM10-associated DNA methylation differences were identified at age 15 in saliva. Benchmarking the timing and cell-type generalizability is critical for epigenetic exposure biomarker assessment.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with time-varying environmental factors that contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD) risk. We sought to test whether DNAm signatures of lifestyle and biochemical factors were associated with MDD to reveal dynamic biomarkers of MDD risk that may be amenable to lifestyle interventions. METHODS: Here, we calculated methylation scores (MS) at multiple p-value thresholds for lifestyle (BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational attainment) and biochemical (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol) factors in Generation Scotland (GS) (N=9,502) and in a replication cohort (ALSPACadults, N=565), using CpG sites reported in previous well-powered methylome-wide association studies. We also compared their predictive accuracy for MDD to a MDD MS in an independent GS sub-sample (N=4,432). FINDINGS: Each trait MS was significantly associated with its corresponding phenotype in GS (betarange=0.089-1.457) and in ALSPAC (betarange=0.078-2.533). Each MS was also significantly associated with MDD before and after adjustment for its corresponding phenotype in GS (betarange=0.053-0.145). After accounting for relevant lifestyle factors, MS for educational attainment (beta=0.094) and alcohol consumption (MSp-value<0.01-0.5; betarange=-0.069-0.083) remained significantly associated with MDD in GS. Smoking (AUC=0.569) and educational attainment (AUC=0.585) MSs could discriminate MDD from controls better than the MDD MS (AUC=0.553) in the independent GS sub-sample. Analyses implicating MDD did not replicate across ALSPAC, although the direction of effect was consistent for all traits when adjusting for the MS corresponding phenotypes. INTERPRETATION: We showed that lifestyle and biochemical MS were associated with MDD before and after adjustment for their corresponding phenotypes (pnominal<0.05), but not when smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI were also included as covariates. MDD results did not replicate in the smaller, female-only independent ALSPAC cohort (NALSPAC=565; NGS=9,502), potentially due to demographic differences or low statistical power, but effect sizes were consistent with the direction reported in GS. DNAm scores for modifiable MDD risk factors may contribute to disease vulnerability and, in some cases, explain additional variance to their observed phenotypes. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.

Abstract: Novel approaches to uncover the molecular etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are highly needed. Even using a powerful tool such as whole exome sequencing (WES), the diagnostic process may still prove long and arduous due to the high clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these conditions. The main strategies to improve the diagnostic rate are based on family segregation, re-evaluation of the clinical features by reverse-phenotyping, re-analysis of unsolved NGS-based cases and epigenetic functional studies. In this article, we described three selected cases from a cohort of patients with NDD in which trio WES was applied, in order to underline the typical challenges encountered during the diagnostic process: (1) an ultra-rare condition caused by a missense variant in MEIS2, identified through the updated Solve-RD re-analysis; (2) a patient with Noonan-like features in which the NGS analysis revealed a novel variant in NIPBL causing Cornelia de Lange syndrome; and (3) a case with de novo variants in genes involved in the chromatin-remodeling complex, for which the study of the epigenetic signature excluded a pathogenic role. In this perspective, we aimed to (i) provide an example of the relevance of the genetic re-analysis of all unsolved cases through network projects on rare diseases; (ii) point out the role and the uncertainties of the reverse phenotyping in the interpretation of the genetic results; and (iii) describe the use of methylation signatures in neurodevelopmental syndromes for the validation of the variants of uncertain significance.

Abstract: In 785 mother-child (50% male) pairs from a longitudinal epidemiological birth cohort, we investigated associations between inflammation-related epigenetic polygenic risk scores (i-ePGS), environmental exposures, cognitive function, and child and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. We examined prenatal and postnatal effects. For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects. The present study supports a link between i-ePGS and child and adolescent mental health.

Abstract: Background: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterised by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Loss of DNA methylation at the telomeric imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) on 11p15 is an important cause of SRS. Methods: We studied the methylation pattern at the H19-IGF2 locus in 201 patients with suspected SRS. In an attempt to categorise the patients into different subgroups, we developed a simple clinical scoring system with respect to readily and unambiguously assessable clinical features. In a second step, the relationship between clinical score and epigenetic status was analysed. Results and conclusions: The scoring system emerged as a powerful tool for identifying those patients with both a definite SRS phenotype and carrying an epimutation at 11p15. 53% of the 201 patients initially enrolled fulfilled the criteria for SRS and about 40% of them exhibited an epimutation at the H19-IGF2 locus. Methylation defects were restricted to patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SRS. Patients carrying epimutations had a more severe phenotype than either the SRS patients with mUPD7 or the idiopathic SRS patients. The majority of patients with methylation abnormalities showed hypomethylation at both the H19 and IGF2 genes. However, we also identified SRS patients where hypomethylation was restricted to either the H19 or the IGF2 gene. Interestingly, we detected epimutations in siblings of normal parents, most likely reflecting germ cell mosaicism in the fathers. In one family, we identified an epimutation in an affected father and his likewise affected daughter.

Abstract: Background: Preterm infants who receive differential red blood cell (RBC) transfusions at birth may show brain structure differences across development, including abnormalities in white matter (WM) structure and organization. This study investigated long-term outcomes of brain structure in female infants born preterm, at an average age of 13 years old, who received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the neonatal period according to a liberal or restrictive approach. Results from this study will increase understanding of the effects of transfusion on the developing brain. Study design and methods: This follow-up study included female preterm infants who participated in a clinical trial and had been randomized at birth to either a liberal or restrictive hematocrit threshold. Brain structures were measured in childhood using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Due to the low number of females in the restrictive transfusion group at follow-up, additional females were recruited for inclusion. Main outcome measures included cerebral and subcortical brain region volumes. Results: Total intracranial volume was significantly decreased in females who were randomized to higher average hematocrit levels at birth. Infants in the liberal transfusion group had proportionately smaller volumes in all measures of regional cerebral WM and subcortical brain volumes, reaching significance for temporal lobe WM and caudate volumes. Conclusion: Female premature infants who received a liberal transfusion threshold at birth had decreased WM volumes, which suggests the potential long-term neurodevelopmental risks associated with liberal transfusion practices.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: ADNP syndrome is a rare Mendelian disorder characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. It is caused by truncating mutations in ADNP, which is involved in chromatin regulation. We hypothesized that the disruption of chromatin regulation might result in specific DNA methylation patterns that could be used in the molecular diagnosis of ADNP syndrome. RESULTS: We identified two distinct and partially opposing genomic DNA methylation episignatures in the peripheral blood samples from 22 patients with ADNP syndrome. The "epi-ADNP-1" episignature included ~ 6000 mostly hypomethylated CpGs, and the "epi-ADNP-2" episignature included ~ 1000 predominantly hypermethylated CpGs. The two signatures correlated with the locations of the ADNP mutations. Epi-ADNP-1 mutations occupy the N- and C-terminus, and epi-ADNP-2 mutations are centered on the nuclear localization signal. The episignatures were enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A classifier trained on these profiles yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with either of the two episignatures. Applying this model to seven patients with uncertain clinical diagnosis enabled reclassification of genetic variants of uncertain significance and assigned new diagnosis when the primary clinical suspicion was not correct. When applied to a large cohort of unresolved patients with developmental delay (N = 1150), the model predicted three additional previously undiagnosed patients to have ADNP syndrome. DNA sequencing of these subjects, wherever available, identified pathogenic mutations within the gene domains predicted by the model. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first Mendelian condition with two distinct episignatures caused by mutations in a single gene. These highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignatures enable diagnosis, screening, and genetic variant classifications in ADNP syndrome.

Abstract: Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error and bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalised linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates.

Abstract: Background: Imprinting disorders (ImpDis) comprise diseases which are caused by aberrant regulation of monoallelically and parent-of-origin-dependent expressed genes. A characteristic molecular change in ImpDis patients is aberrant methylation signatures at disease-specific loci, without an obvious DNA change at the specific differentially methylated region (DMR). However, there is a growing number of reports on multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLIDs), i.e. aberrant methylation at different DMRs in the same patient. These MLIDs account for a significant number of patients with specific ImpDis, and several reports indicate a central role of pathogenic maternal effect variants in their aetiology by affecting the maturation of the oocyte and the early embryo. Though several studies on the prevalence and the molecular causes of MLID have been conducted, homogeneous datasets comprising both genomic and methylation data are still lacking. Results: Based on a cohort of 36 MLID patients, we here present both methylation data obtained from next-generation sequencing (NGS, ImprintSeq) approaches and whole-exome sequencing (WES). The compilation of methylation data did not reveal a disease-specific MLID episignature, and a predisposition for the phenotypic modification was not obvious as well. In fact, this lack of epigenotype–phenotype correlation might be related to the mosaic distribution of imprinting defects and their functional relevance in specific tissues. Conclusions: Due to the higher sensitivity of NGS-based approaches, we suggest that ImprintSeq might be offered at reference centres in case of ImpDis patients with unusual phenotypes but MLID negative by conventional tests. By WES, additional MLID causes than the already known maternal effect variants could not be identified, neither in the patients nor in the maternal exomes. In cases with negative WES results, it is currently unclear to what extent either environmental factors or undetected genetic variants contribute to MLID.

Abstract: Prenatal maternal smoking is associated with low birthweight, neurological disorders, and asthma in exposed children. DNA methylation signatures can function as biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure. However, the robustness of DNA methylation signatures across child ages, genetic ancestry groups, or tissues is not clear. Using coefficients from a meta-analysis of prenatal smoke exposure and DNA methylation in newborn cord blood, we created polymethylation scores of saliva DNA methylation from children at ages 9 and 15 in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. In the full sample at age 9 (n = 753), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.51 (95%CI: 0.35, 0.66) standard deviation higher polymethylation score. The direction and magnitude of the association was consistent in European and African genetic ancestry samples. In the full sample at age 15 (n = 747), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.48 (95%CI: 0.32, 0.63) standard deviation higher polymethylation score, and the association was attenuated among the European and Admixed-Latin genetic ancestry samples. The polymethylation score classified prenatal smoke exposure accurately (AUC age 9 = 0.77, age 15 = 0.76). Including the polymethylation score increased the AUC of base model covariates by 5 (95% CI: (2.1, 7.2)) percentage points, while including a single candidate site in the AHRR gene did not (P-value = 0.19). Polymethylation scores for prenatal smoking were portable across genetic ancestries and more accurate than an individual DNA methylation site. Polymethylation scores from saliva samples could serve as robust and practical biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure.

Abstract: SRSF1 (also known as ASF/SF2) is a non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (non-snRNP) that belongs to the arginine/serine (R/S) domain family. It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Abstract: Background: Transcriptomic research of blood cell lineages supports the understanding of distinct features of the immunopathology in human malaria. Methods: We used microarray hybridization, validated by real-time RT-PCR to analyze whole blood gene expression in healthy Gabonese children and children with various conditions of Plasmodium falciparum infection, including i) asymptomatic infection, ii) uncomplicated malaria, iii) malaria associated with severe anemia and iv) cerebral malaria. Findings: Our data indicate that the expression profile of 22 genes significantly differed among the investigated groups. Immunoglobulin production, complement regulation and IFN beta signaling, in particular IRF7 and ISRE binding signatures in the corresponding genes, were most conspicuous. Down-regulation in cerebral malaria seems to rely on AhRF, GABP and HIF1 hypoxia transcription factors. ARG1, BPI, CD163, IFI27, HP and TNFAIP6 transcript levels correlated positively with lactatemia, and negatively with hemoglobin concentrations. Interpretation: Differences in gene expression profile reflect distinct immunopathological mechanisms of P. falciparum infection. They emerge as potential prognostic markers for early therapeutic measures and need to be validated further.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Disadvantaged socio-economic position (SEP) in childhood is associated with increased adult mortality and morbidity. We aimed to establish whether childhood SEP was associated with differential methylation of adult DNA. METHODS: Forty adult males from the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study were selected from SEP extremes in both early childhood and mid-adulthood. We performed genome-wide methylation analysis on blood DNA taken at 45 years using MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation). We mapped in triplicate the methylation state of promoters of approximately 20,000 genes and 400 microRNAs. Probe methylation scores were averaged across triplicates and differential methylation between groups of individuals was determined. Differentially methylated promoter sites of selected genes were validated using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA. RESULTS: Variably methylated probes (9112 from n = 223,359 on the microarray) corresponded to 6176 gene promoters with at least one variable probe. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of probes obtained from the 500 most variable promoters revealed a cluster enriched with high SEP individuals confirming that SEP differences contribute to overall epigenetic variation. Methylation levels for 1252 gene promoters were associated with childhood SEP vs 545 promoters for adulthood SEP. Functionally, associations with childhood SEP appear in promoters of genes enriched in key cell signalling pathways. The differentially methylated promoters associated with SEP cluster in megabase-sized regions of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: Adult blood DNA methylation profiles show more associations with childhood SEP than adult SEP. Organization of these associations across the genome suggests a well-defined epigenetic pattern linked to early socio-economic environment.

Abstract: Simple Summary A subset of patients with an intermediate risk for renal cell carcinoma have an indolent disease course. For these patients, the initiation of treatment for metastatic disease can be safely delayed by entering a watchful waiting period. At present, we are not able to identify those patients with indolent disease and the minor group of patients with rapidly progressive disease requiring earlier initiation of systemic treatment. In this study, we investigate whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used as a blood-based biomarker to identify those patients with rapid progression. Methylated cfDNA profiles were used as a proxy for tumor load in blood. cfDNA methylation patterns were associated with the time to radiological progression, but not with the watchful waiting time. The results of this study do not provide definite proof that cfDNA methylation patterns are associated with WW time. According to the current guidelines, watchful waiting (WW) is a feasible option for patients with good or intermediate prognosis renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). However, some patients rapidly progress during WW, requiring the initiation of treatment. Here, we explore whether we can identify those patients using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation. We first defined a panel of RCC-specific circulating methylation markers by intersecting differentially methylated regions from a publicly available dataset with known RCC methylation markers from the literature. The resulting RCC-specific methylation marker panel of 22 markers was subsequently evaluated for an association with rapid progression by methylated DNA sequencing (MeD-seq) in serum from 10 HBDs and 34 RCC patients with a good or intermediate prognosis starting WW in the IMPACT-RCC study. Patients with an elevated RCC-specific methylation score compared to HBDs had a shorter progression-free survival (PFS, p = 0.018), but not a shorter WW-time (p = 0.15). Cox proportional hazards regression showed that only the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria were significantly associated with WW time (HR 2.01, p = 0.01), whereas only our RCC-specific methylation score (HR 4.45, p = 0.02) was significantly associated with PFS. The results of this study suggest that cfDNA methylation is predictive of PFS but not WW.

Abstract: The lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B) gene product is important for epigenetic modifications associated with active gene transcription in normal development and in maintaining proper neural function. Pathogenic variants in KMT2B have been associated with childhood-onset Dystonia-28 and Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 68 (MRD 68) for cases of neurodevelopmental impairment without dystonia (DYT28; OMIM 617284 and MRD68; OMIM 619934, respectively). Since its first description in 2016, approximately one hundred KMT2B genetic variants have been reported with heterogeneous phenotypes, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotypes. KMT2B-related disorders share many overlapping phenotypic characteristics with other neurodevelopmental disorders and delayed dystonia, that can appear later in childhood, often delaying clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, conventional genetic testing may not always provide actionable information (e.g., gene panel selection based on early clinical presentation or variants of uncertain significance), which prevents patients and families from obtaining early access to treatments and support. Herein, we describe the early diagnosis of KMT2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder by DNA methylation episignature testing in a 4-year-old patient without features of dystonia at diagnosis, which is reported to develop in more than 80% of KMT2B-related disorder cases. The proband, a 4-year-old female of Jewish-Israeli descent, presented with speech delay, microcephaly, poor weight gain, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, dysmorphism, intellectual disabilities and joint hyperlaxity, but presented no signs of dystonia at initial evaluation. Episignature screening in this pre-symptomatic patient enabled accurate genetic diagnosis and timely and actionable intervention earlier in the natural history of Childhood-onset Dystonia-28.

Abstract: Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with intellectual disability/developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple medical comorbidities. HVDAS is caused by mutations in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). A recent study identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 22 individuals with HVDAS, adding to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders with an epigenetic signature. This methylation signature segregated those with HVDAS into two groups based on the location of the mutations. Here, we conducted an independent study on 24 individuals with HVDAS and replicated the existence of the two mutation-dependent episignatures. To probe whether the two distinct episignatures correlate with clinical outcomes, we used deep behavioral and neurobiological data from two prospective cohorts of individuals with a genetic diagnosis of HVDAS. We found limited phenotypic differences between the two HVDAS-affected groups and no evidence that individuals with more widespread methylation changes are more severely affected. Moreover, in spite of the methylation changes, we observed no profound alterations in the blood transcriptome of individuals with HVDAS. Our data warrant caution in harnessing methylation signatures in HVDAS as a tool for clinical stratification, at least with regard to behavioral phenotypes.

Abstract: Pathogenic variants in genes are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation resulting in congenital anomalies, with most patients displaying a neurodevelopmental disorder and dysmorphism. Arboleda-Tham syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in KAT6A (Lysine Acetyltransferase 6A; OMIM 601408) has been recently described as a new neurodevelopmental disorder. Herein, we describe a patient characterized by complex phenotype subsequently diagnosed using the clinical exome sequencing (CES) with Arboleda-Tham syndrome (ARTHS; OMIM 616268). The analysis revealed the presence of de novo pathogenic variant in KAT6A gene, a nucleotide c.3385C>T substitution that introduces a premature termination codon (p.Arg1129*). The need for straight multidisciplinary collaboration and accurate clinical description findings (bowel obstruction/megacolon/intestinal malrotation) was emphasized, together with the utility of CES in establishing an etiological basis in clinical and genetical heterogeneous conditions. Therefore, considering the phenotypic characteristics, the condition's rarity and the reviewed literature, we propose additional diagnostic criteria that could help in the development of future clinical diagnostic guidelines. This was possible thanks to objective examinations performed during the long follow-up period, which permitted scrupulous registration of phenotypic changes over time to further assess this rare disorder. Finally, given that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns used for diagnostic testing and/or as biomarker of disease, a specific episignature for ARTHS has been identified.

Abstract: Background: DNA methylation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders. It is reported to be an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival (OS). Our aim was to analyze the role of global DNA methylation using an anti-5-methylcytosine (5-MC) antibody by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of bone marrow biopsy (BM Bx) specimens in MDS patients, assessing correlations with various clinical and biological prognostic factors. Material and methods: A total of 59 MDS cases, classified as per the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 guidelines, were evaluated over a period of 4 years. Clinical data were retrieved from departmental case records and anti-5-MC expression was analyzed with formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections of BM Bx specimens of MDS patients and controls. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 52 years (15-85years). Patients were categorized into low risk (59%) and high risk (41%) according to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The median follow-up time was 10 months (1 to 37 months). We generated a methylation score (M-score) using anti-5-MC and with the derived cut-off of 30.5 from the receiver operator curve (ROC), there was a significant difference between the two groups in the percentage of BM blasts (p=0.01), WHO sub-type (p=0.01), IPSS (p=0.004), progression to AML (p=0.04) on univariate analysis. Interestingly, patients showing a high M-score (M-score ≥ 30.5) demonstrated a significantly shorter OS and progression to AML. However, on multivariate analysis, only BM blasts (p=0.01) and IPSS (p=0.02) remained independent variables for progression to AML and OS respectively. Conclusion: Immunostaining with anti-5-MC antibody with BM Bx samples is a simple and cost effective technique to detect global methylation, a powerful tool to predict overall survival in patients with MDS.

Abstract: Recent efforts have focused on developing methylation risk scores (MRS), a weighted sum of the individual's DNA methylation (DNAm) values of pre-selected CpG sites. Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences.

Abstract: Background: Clinical parameter-based nomograms and staging systems provide limited information for the prediction of survival in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients. In this study, we developed a methylation signature that precisely predicts overall survival (OS) after surgery. Methods: An epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted for two independent cohorts (discovery cohort, n=164; validation cohort, n=170) from three hepatobiliary centers in China. By referring to differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we proposed the concept of prognostically methylated regions (PMRs), which were composed of consecutive prognostically methylated CpGs (PMCs). Using machine learning strategies (Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selector regression), a prognostic methylation score (PMS) was constructed based on 14 PMRs in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the validation cohort. Results: The C-indices of the PMS for predicting OS in the discovery and validation cohorts were 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. In the whole cohort, the PMS was an independent predictor of OS [hazard ratio (HR) =8.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.48-12.04; P<0.001], and the C-index (0.78) of the PMS was significantly higher than that of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSM) nomogram (0.69, P<0.001), the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHBSH) nomogram (0.67, P<0.001), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system (0.61, P<0.001), and MEGNA prognostic score (0.60, P<0.001). The patients in quartile 4 of PMS could benefit from adjuvant therapy (AT) (HR =0.54; 95% CI: 0.32-0.91; log-rank P=0.043), whereas those in the quartiles 1-3 could not. However, other nomograms and staging system failed to do so. Further analyses of potential mechanisms showed that the PMS was associated with tumor biological behaviors, pathway activation, and immune microenvironment. Conclusions: The PMS could improve the prognostic accuracy and identify patients who would benefit from AT for ICC patients, and might facilitate decisions in treatment of ICC patients.

Abstract: Purpose: Gabriele-de Vries syndrome (GADEVS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and distinct facial features. To refine the phenotype and to better understand the molecular basis of the syndrome, we analyzed clinical data and performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a series of individuals carrying a YY1 variant. Methods: Clinical data were collected for 13 individuals not yet reported through an international call for collaboration. DNA was collected for 11 of these individuals and 2 previously reported individuals in an attempt to delineate a specific DNA methylation signature in GADEVS. Results: Phenotype in most individuals overlapped with the previously described features. We described 1 individual with atypical phenotype, heterozygous for a missense variant in a domain usually not involved in individuals with YY1 pathogenic missense variations. We also described a specific peripheral blood DNA methylation profile associated with YY1 variants. Conclusion: We reported a distinct DNA methylation episignature in GADEVS. We expanded the clinical profile of GADEVS to include thin/sparse hair and cryptorchidism. We also highlighted the utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for classification of variants of unknown clinical significance.

Abstract: Understanding the biological mechanisms behind multimorbidity patterns in adolescence is important as they may act as intermediary risk factor for long-term health. We aimed to explore relationship between prenatal exposures and adolescent's psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits mediated through epigenetic biomarkers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used data from mother-child dyads from pregnancy and adolescents at 16-17 years from two prospective cohorts: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) and Raine Study from Australia. Factor analysis was applied to generate two different latent factor structures: (a) prenatal exposures and (b) adolescence psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits. Furthermore, three types of epigenetic biomarkers were included: (1) DNA methylation score for maternal smoking during pregnancy (DNAmMSS), (2) DNAm age estimate PhenoAge and (3) DNAm estimate for telomere length (DNAmTL). Similar factor structure was observed between both cohorts yielding three prenatal factors, namely BMI (Body Mass Index), SOP (Socio-Obstetric-Profile), and Lifestyle, and four adolescent factors: Anthropometric, Insulin-Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, and Mental health. In the SEM pathways, stronger direct effects of F1prenatal-BMI (NFBC1986 = beta: 0.27; Raine = beta: 0.39) and F2prenatal-SOP (beta: -0.11) factors were observed on adolescent psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We observed an indirect effect of prenatal latent factors through epigenetic markers on a psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity factor in Raine study (P < 0.05). The present study exemplifies an evidence-based approach in two different birth cohorts to demonstrate similar composite structure of prenatal exposures and psycho-cardiometabolic traits (despite cultural, social, and genetic differences) and a common plausible pathway between them through underlying epigenetic markers.

Abstract: Au-Kline syndrome (AKS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with multiple malformations and a characteristic facial gestalt. The first individuals ascertained carried de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in HNRNPK. Here, we report 32 individuals with AKS (26 previously unpublished), including 13 with de novo missense variants. We propose new clinical diagnostic criteria for AKS that differentiate it from the clinically overlapping Kabuki syndrome and describe a significant phenotypic expansion to include individuals with missense variants who present with subtle facial features and few or no malformations. Many gene-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures have been identified for neurodevelopmental syndromes. Because HNRNPK has roles in chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hypothesized that pathogenic variants in HNRNPK may be associated with a specific DNAm signature. Here, we report a unique DNAm signature for AKS due to LoF HNRNPK variants, distinct from controls and Kabuki syndrome. This DNAm signature is also identified in some individuals with de novo HNRNPK missense variants, confirming their pathogenicity and the phenotypic expansion of AKS to include more subtle phenotypes. Furthermore, we report that some individuals with missense variants have an “intermediate” DNAm signature that parallels their milder clinical presentation, suggesting the presence of an epi-genotype phenotype correlation. In summary, the AKS DNAm signature may help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of AKS. This DNAm signature also effectively supported clinical syndrome delineation and is a valuable aid for variant interpretation in individuals where a clinical diagnosis of AKS is unclear, particularly for mild presentations.

Abstract: Background : We previously associated HIST1H1E mutations causing Rahman syndrome with a specific genome-wide methylation pattern. Results: Methylome analysis from peripheral blood samples of six affected subjects led us to identify a specific hypomethylated profile. This "episignature" was enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A computational classifier yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting subjects with Rahman syndrome. Applying this model to a cohort of undiagnosed probands allowed us to reach diagnosis in one subject. Conclusions: We demonstrate an epigenetic signature in subjects with Rahman syndrome that can be used to reach molecular diagnosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements and/or postures. Heterozygous variants in lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), encoding a histone H3 methyltransferase, have been associated with a childhood-onset, progressive and complex form of dystonia (dystonia 28, DYT28). Since 2016, more than one hundred rare KMT2B variants have been reported, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense and other in-frame changes, many having an uncertain clinical impact. RESULTS: We characterize the genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of a cohort of 18 patients with pathogenic and unclassified KMT2B variants. We resolve the "episignature" associated with KMT2B haploinsufficiency, proving that this approach is robust in diagnosing clinically unsolved cases, properly classifying them with respect to other partially overlapping dystonic phenotypes, other rare neurodevelopmental disorders and healthy controls. Notably, defective KMT2B function in DYT28 causes a non-random DNA hypermethylation across the genome, selectively involving promoters and other regulatory regions positively controlling gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinctive DNA hypermethylation pattern associated with DYT28, provide an epigenetic signature for this disorder enabling accurate diagnosis and reclassification of ambiguous genetic findings and suggest potential therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Purpose: Witteveen-Kolk syndrome (WITKOS) is a rare, autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous loss-of-function alterations in the SIN3A gene. WITKOS has variable expressivity that commonly overlaps with other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we characterized a distinct DNA methylation epigenetic signature (episignature) distinguishing WITKOS from unaffected individuals as well as individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders with episignatures and described 9 previously unpublished individuals with SIN3A haploinsufficiency. Methods: We studied the phenotypic characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the identification of the episignature and building of a predictive diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples. Results: A predominantly hypomethylated DNA methylation profile specific to WITKOS was identified, and the classifier model was able to diagnose a previously unresolved test case. The episignature was sensitive enough to detect individuals with varying degrees of phenotypic severity carrying SIN3A haploinsufficient variants. Conclusion: We identified a novel, robust episignature in WITKOS due to SIN3A haploinsufficiency. This episignature has the potential to aid identification and diagnosis of individuals with WITKOS.

Abstract: Purpose: Patients with rare or ultra-rare genetic diseases, which affect 350 million people worldwide, may experience a diagnostic odyssey. High-throughput sequencing leads to an etiological diagnosis in up to 50% of individuals with heterogeneous neurodevelopmental or malformation disorders. There is a growing interest in additional omics technologies in translational research settings to examine the remaining unsolved cases. Methods: We gathered 30 individuals with malformation syndromes and/or severe neurodevelopmental disorders with negative trio exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization results through a multicenter project. We applied short-read genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation analysis, in that order, as complementary translational research tools for a molecular diagnosis. Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood. Conclusion: Overall, our integrated genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylation analysis solved 10/30 (33.3%) cases and identified a strong candidate gene in 4/30 (13.3%) of the patients with rare neurodevelopmental disorders and negative exome sequencing results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is closely associated with a phenotype that includes brain dysmaturation and neurocognitive impairment, commonly termed Encephalopathy of Prematurity (EoP), of which systemic inflammation is considered a key driver. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00 to 4.71 , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 0.218 ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 0.371 ), independent of other confounding exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is of public health concern, and understanding the biological mechanisms can help to promote smoking cessation campaigns. This non-systematic review focuses on the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring's epigenome, consistent in chemical modifications of the genome that regulate gene expression. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy is consistently associated with offspring's DNA methylation changes, both in the placenta and blood. These studies indicate that effects on blood DNA methylation can persist for years, and that the longer the duration of the exposure and the higher the dose, the larger the effects. Hence, DNA methylation scores have been developed to estimate past exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy as biomarkers. There is robust evidence for DNA methylation alterations associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy; however, the role of sex, ethnicity, and genetic background needs further exploration. Moreover, there are no conclusive studies about exposure to low doses or during the preconception period. Similarly, studies on tissues other than the placenta and blood are scarce, and cell-type specificity within tissues needs further investigation. In addition, biological interpretation of DNA methylation findings requires multi-omics data, poorly available in epidemiological settings. Finally, although several mediation analyses link DNA methylation changes with health outcomes, they do not allow causal inference. For this, a combination of data from multiple study designs will be essential in the future to better address this topic. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

Abstract: KDM5C encodes a demethylase of the histone H3 lysine 4 residue, involved in chromatin regulation and gene expression. Hemizygous KDM5C pathogenic variants cause X-linked intellectual disability of Claes-Jensen type. Because of its mode of inheritance and the low specificity of the clinical phenotype, interpretation of variants can be difficult, hence the need for functional studies and biomarkers specific to this disorder. We present the case of a male patient with intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities and subtle dysmorphic features, in which genetic investigation identified a hemizygous novel missense KDM5C variant of uncertain significance (VUS), inherited from his asymptomatic mother and present in his paucisymptomatic sister. We assessed the global genomic DNA methylation status from a whole blood sample of the proband. Global DNA methylation profiling specifically identified the recently discovered epi-signature of Claes-Jensen syndrome. This result served as a biomarker which independently highlighted KDM5C as the cause of the disorder in this patient. Because of the X-linked mode of inheritance, variant reclassification had a high impact on genetic counseling in this family. This example highlights the value of global methylome profiling in situations of variants of uncertain significance in genes with a known specific epi-signature.

Abstract: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is diagnosed using the histopathological Weiss score (WS), but remains clinically elusive unless it has metastasized or grows locally invasive. Previously, we proposed the objective IGF2 methylation score as diagnostic tool for ACC. This multicenter European cohort study validates these findings. Patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from adrenocortical tumor patients. DNA was isolated from frozen specimens, where after DMR2, CTCF3, and H19 were pyrosequenced. The predictive value of the methylation score for malignancy, defined by the WS or metastasis development, was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic and Cox regression analyses. Seventy-six ACC patients and 118 patients with adrenocortical adenomas were included from seven centers. The methylation score and tumor size were independently associated with the pathological ACC diagnosis (OR 3.756 95% CI 2.224-6.343; OR 1.467 95% CI 1.202-1.792, respectively; Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.903), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.957 (95% CI 0.930-0.984). The methylation score alone resulted in an AUC of 0.910 (95% CI 0.866-0.952). Cox regression analysis revealed that the methylation score, WS and tumor size predicted development of metastases in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only the WS predicted development of metastasis (OR 1.682 95% CI 1.285-2.202; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we validated the high diagnostic accuracy of the IGF2 methylation score for diagnosing ACC in a multicenter European cohort study. Considering the known limitations of the WS, the objective IGF2 methylation score could potentially provide extra guidance on decisions on postoperative strategies in adrenocortical tumor patients.

Abstract: Mutations in ADNP result in Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. Here, we describe the first de novo intronic deletion, affecting the splice-acceptor site of the first coding ADNP exon in a five-year-old girl with developmental delay and autism. Whereas exome sequencing failed to detect the non-coding deletion, genome-wide CpG methylation analysis revealed an episignature suggestive of a Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome diagnosis. This diagnosis was further supported by PhenoScore, a novel facial recognition software package. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing resolved the three-base pair ADNP deletion c.[-5-1_-4del] with transcriptome sequencing showing this deletion leads to skipping of exon 4. An N-terminal truncated protein could not be detected in transfection experiments with a mutant expression vector in HEK293T cells, strongly suggesting this is a first confirmed diagnosis exclusively due to haploinsufficiency of the ADNP gene. Pathway analysis of the methylome indicated differentially methylated genes involved in brain development, the cytoskeleton, locomotion, behavior, and muscle development. Along the same line, transcriptome analysis identified most of the differentially expressed genes as upregulated, in line with the hypomethylated CpG episignature and confirmed the involvement of the cytoskeleton and muscle development pathways that are also affected in patient cell lines and animal models. In conclusion, this novel mutation for the first time demonstrates that Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome can be caused by a loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, our study elegantly illustrates the use of EpiSignatures, WGS and Phenoscore as novel complementary diagnostic tools in case a of negative WES result. Copyright © 2024.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuroblastoma outcome prediction remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims at establishing novel prognostic tumor DNA methylation biomarkers. In total, 396 low- and high-risk primary tumors were analyzed, of which 87 were profiled using methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing for differential methylation analysis between prognostic patient groups. Subsequently, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were developed for 78 top-ranking differentially methylated regions and tested on two independent cohorts of 132 and 177 samples, respectively. Further, a new statistical framework was used to identify a robust set of MSP assays of which the methylation score (i.e. the percentage of methylated assays) allows accurate outcome prediction. Survival analyses were performed on the individual target level, as well as on the combined multimarker signature. As a result of the differential DNA methylation assessment by MBD sequencing, 58 of the 78 MSP assays were designed in regions previously unexplored in neuroblastoma, and 36 are located in non-promoter or non-coding regions. In total, 5 individual MSP assays (located in CCDC177, NXPH1, lnc-MRPL3-2, lnc-TREX1-1 and one on a region from chromosome 8 with no further annotation) predict event-free survival and 4 additional assays (located in SPRED3, TNFAIP2, NPM2 and CYYR1) also predict overall survival. Furthermore, a robust 58-marker methylation signature predicting overall and event-free survival was established. In conclusion, this study encompasses the largest DNA methylation biomarker study in neuroblastoma so far. We identified and independently validated several novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as a prognostic 58-marker methylation signature.

Abstract: Maternal smoking has been linked to adverse health outcomes in newborns but the extent to which it impacts newborn health has not been quantified through an aggregated cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) score. Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p < 5×10-5). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], p=5.5×10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8×10-9) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (p > 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (-0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (-0.043±0.013kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birthweight in newborns, in both white European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Genome sequencing (GS)-specific diagnostic rates in prospective tightly ascertained exome sequencing (ES)-negative intellectual disability (ID) cohorts have not been reported extensively. METHODS: ES, GS, epigenetic signatures, and long-read sequencing diagnoses were assessed in 74 trios with at least moderate ID. RESULTS: The ES diagnostic yield was 42 of 74 (57%). GS diagnoses were made in 9 of 32 (28%) ES-unresolved families. Repeated ES with a contemporary pipeline on the GS-diagnosed families identified 8 of 9 single-nucleotide variations/copy-number variations undetected in older ES, confirming a GS-unique diagnostic rate of 1 in 32 (3%). Episignatures contributed diagnostic information in 9% with GS corroboration in 1 of 32 (3%) and diagnostic clues in 2 of 32 (6%). A genetic etiology for ID was detected in 51 of 74 (69%) families. Twelve candidate disease genes were identified. Contemporary ES followed by GS cost US$4976 (95% CI: $3704; $6969) per diagnosis and first-line GS at a cost of $7062 (95% CI: $6210; $8475) per diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Performing GS only in ID trios would be cost equivalent to ES if GS were available at $2435, about a 60% reduction from current prices. This study demonstrates that first-line GS achieves higher diagnostic rate than contemporary ES but at a higher cost. Copyright © 2024 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

Abstract: CHD8, a major autism gene, functions in chromatin remodelling and has various roles involving several biological pathways. Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype–phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26–28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to maternal smoking is detrimental to child health but its association with risk of cancer has seldom been investigated. Maternal smoking induces widespread and long-lasting DNA methylation changes, which we study here for association with risk of cancer in adulthood. METHODS: Eight prospective case-control studies nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study were used to assess associations between maternal-smoking-associated methylation marks in blood and risk of several cancers: breast (n = 406 cases), colorectal (n = 814), gastric (n = 166), kidney (n = 139), lung (n = 327), prostate (n = 847) and urothelial (n = 404) cancer and B-cell lymphoma (n = 426). We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between cancer and five methylation scores calculated as weighted averages for 568, 19, 15, 28 and 17 CpG sites. Models were adjusted for confounders, including personal smoking history (smoking status, pack-years, age at starting and quitting) and methylation scores for personal smoking. RESULTS: All methylation scores for maternal smoking were strongly positively associated with risk of urothelial cancer. Risk estimates were only slightly attenuated after adjustment for smoking history, other potential confounders and methylation scores for personal smoking. Potential negative associations were observed with risk of lung cancer and B-cell lymphoma. No associations were observed for other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We found that methylation marks of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking are associated with increased risk of urothelial cancer. Our study demonstrates the potential for using DNA methylation to investigate the impact of early-life, unmeasured exposures on later-life cancer risk.

Abstract: Inflammation is implicated in depression and psychosis, including association of childhood inflammatory markers on the subsequent risk of developing symptoms. However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N = up-to 6401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; beta = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020-0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

Abstract: DNA methylation analysis may improve risk stratification in cervical screening. We used a pan-epigenomic approach to identify new methylation markers along the continuum of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer. Physician-collected samples (54 normal, 50 CIN1, 40 CIN2 and 42 CIN3) were randomly selected from women at a single-center colposcopy clinic. Extracted DNA was subjected to Illumina Infinium EPIC array analysis, and methylation was assessed blinded to histopathological and clinical data. CpG sites whose state of methylation correlated with lesion grade were assessed (Spearman correlation), and a weighted methylation score was calculated comparing normal to CIN3. Validation of the top selected genes was performed in an independent cohort (100 normal, 50 CIN1, 50 CIN2, 50 CIN3 and 8 cervical cancers) of new patients, referred for colposcopic examination at three hospitals, using targeted DNA methylation Illumina amplicon sequencing. The relationship between a combined weighted marker score and progression from normal through precancerous lesions and cervical cancer was compared using one-way ANOVA. Our analyses revealed 7,715 CpGs whose methylation level correlated with progression (from normal to CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3), with a significant trend of increased methylation with lesion grade. We shortlisted a bigenic (hyaluronan synthase 1, HAS1 and ATPase phospholipid transporting 10A, ATP10A corresponding to cg03419058 and cg13944175 sites) marker set; r = 0.55, p < 0.0001. Validation of the four most discriminating genes (CA10, DPP10, FMN2 and HAS1) showed a significant correlation between methylation levels and disease progression (p-value < 2.2 × 10−16, adjusted R2 = 0.952). Translational research of the identified genes to future clinical applications is warranted.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Physiological maternal stress response, such as imbalance in the glucocorticoid pathway and immune system seems to be mediated by DNA methylation (DNAm) and might translate intrauterine stress exposures into phenotypic changes in a sex-specific manner. DNAm in specific sites can also predict newborn gestational age and gestational age acceleration (GAA). GAA occurs when the predicted biological age is higher than the chronological age. In adults, poor health outcomes related to this deviance are well documented and raise questions for the interpretation and prediction in early stages of life. Boys seem to be more vulnerable to intrauterine stress exposure than girls; however, the mechanisms of adaptive sex-specific responses are still unclear. We hypothesize that intrauterine stress exposure is associated with GAA and could be different in boys and girls if inflammatory or glucocorticoid pathways exposure is considered. RESULTS: Using the Western Region Birth Cohort (ROC-Sao Paulo, Brazil) (n = 83), we calculated DNAm age and GAA from cord blood samples. Two epigenetic risk scores were calculated as an indirect proxy for low-grade inflammation (i-ePGS) and for glucocorticoid exposure (GES). Multivariate linear regression models were applied to investigate associations of GAA with prenatal exposures. The i-ePGS and GES were included in different models with the same co-variates considering sex interactions. The first multivariate model investigating inflammatory exposure (adj. R2 = 0.31, p = < 0.001) showed that GAA was positively associated with i-ePGS (CI, 0.26-113.87, p = 0.049) and negative pregnancy-related feelings (CI, 0.04-0.48 p = 0.019). No sex interaction was observed. The second model investigating glucocorticoid exposure (adj. R2 = 0.32, p = < 0.001) showed that the higher was the GAA was associated with a lower the lower was the GES in girls (CI, 0.04-2.55, p = 0.044). In both models, maternal self-reported mental disorder was negatively associated with GAA. CONCLUSION: Prenatal epigenetic score of exposure to low-grade inflammatory was a predictor of GAA for both sexes. Glucocorticoid epigenetic score seems to be more important to GAA in girls. This study supports the evidence of sex-specificity in stress response, suggesting the glucocorticoid as a possible pathway adopted by girls to accelerate the maturation in an adverse condition.

Abstract: Objectives: This study aimed to identify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by developing different machine learning (ML) models based on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) methylation and environmental stress. Methods: The data were collected from 291 patients with MDD and 100 healthy control participants: individual basic information, the Negative Life Events Scale (NLES) scores, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores and the methylation level at 38 CpG sites in TPH2. Information gain was used to select critical input variables. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to build recognition models, which were evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to evaluate features importance. Results: Gender, NLES scores, CTQ scores and 13 CpG sites in TPH2 gene were considered as predictors in the models. Three ML algorithms showed satisfactory performance in predicting MDD and the BPNN model indicated best prediction effects. Conclusion: ML models with TPH2 methylation and environmental stress were identified to possess great performance in identifying patients with MDD, which provided precious experience for artificial intelligence to assist traditional diagnostic methods in the future.

Abstract: Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is a Mendelian syndromic intellectual disability (ID) condition associated with hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, and characteristic facies caused by pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene. Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rare KMT2A variants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature for KMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2A gene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease.

Abstract: Heterozygous ARID1B variants result in Coffin-Siris syndrome. Features may include hypoplastic nails, slow growth, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Most reported cases are due to ARID1B loss of function variants. We report a boy with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, aspiration, recurrent respiratory infections, slow growth, and hypotonia without a clinical diagnosis, where a previously unreported ARID1B missense variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. The pathogenicity of this variant was refined through combined methodologies including genome-wide methylation signature analysis (EpiSign), Machine Learning (ML) facial phenotyping, and LIRICAL. Trio exome sequencing and EpiSign were performed. ML facial phenotyping compared facial images using FaceMatch and GestaltMatcher to syndrome-specific libraries to prioritize the trio exome bioinformatic pipeline gene list output. Phenotype-driven variant prioritization was performed with LIRICAL. A de novo heterozygous missense variant, ARID1B p.(Tyr1268His), was reported as a variant of uncertain significance. The ACMG classification was refined to likely pathogenic by a supportive methylation signature, ML facial phenotyping, and prioritization through LIRICAL. The ARID1B genotype-phenotype has been expanded through an extended analysis of missense variation through genome-wide methylation signatures, ML facial phenotyping, and likelihood-ratio gene prioritization.

Abstract: Craniosynostosis may present in isolation, 'non-syndromic', or with additional congenital anomalies/neurodevelopmental disorders, 'syndromic'. Clinical focus shifted from confirming classical syndromic cases to offering genetic testing to all craniosynostosis patients. This retrospective study assesses diagnostic yield of molecular testing by investigating prevalences of chromosomal and monogenic (likely) pathogenic variants in an 11-year cohort of 1020 craniosynostosis patients. 502 children underwent genetic testing. Pathogenic variants were identified in 174 patients (35%). Diagnostic yield was significantly higher in syndromic craniosynostosis (62%) than in non-syndromic craniosynostosis (6%). Before whole exome sequencing (WES) emerged, single-gene testing was performed using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Diagnostic yield was 11% and was highest for EFNB1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and IL11RA. Diagnostic yield for copy number variant analysis using microarray was 8%. From 2015 onwards, the WES craniosynostosis panel was implemented, with a yield of 10%. In unsolved, mainly syndromic, cases suspected of a genetic cause, additional WES panels (multiple congenital anomalies (MCA)/intellectual disability (ID)) or open exome analysis were performed with an 18% diagnostic yield. To conclude, microarray and the WES craniosynostosis panel are key to identifying pathogenic variants. in craniosynostosis patients. Given the advances in genetic diagnostics, we should look beyond the scope of the WES craniosynostosis panel and consider extensive genetic diagnostics (e.g. open exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and episignature analysis) if no diagnosis is obtained through microarray and/or WES craniosynostosis panel. If parents are uncomfortable with more extensive diagnostics, MCA or ID panels may be considered. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract: Episignatures are popular tools for the diagnosis of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.

Abstract: Rapid postnatal growth is associated with increased risk of childhood adiposity. The aim of this study was to establish whether this pathway is mediated by altered DNA methylation and gene expression. Two distinct cohorts, one preterm (n=121) and one term born (n=6,990), were studied. Exploratory analyses were performed using microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in whole blood from children defined as "slow" (n=10) compared with "rapid" (n=10) postnatal (term to 12 weeks corrected age) growers. Methylation within the identified TACSTD2 gene was measured in both cohorts, and rs61779296 genotype was determined by Pyrosequencing or imputation and analyzed in relation to body composition at 9-15 years of age. In cohort 1, TACSTD2 expression was inversely correlated with methylation (P=0.016), and both measures were associated with fat mass (expression, P=0.049; methylation, P=0.037). Although associated with gene expression (cohort 1, P=0.008) and methylation (cohort 1, P=2.98x10(-11); cohort 2, P=3.43x10(-15)), rs61779296 was not associated with postnatal growth or fat mass in either cohort following multiple regression analysis. Hence, the lack of association between fat mass and a methylation proxy SNP suggests that reverse causation or confounding may explain the initial association between fat mass and gene regulation. Noncausal methylation patterns may still be useful predictors of later adiposity.

Abstract: Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders customarily present with complex and overlapping symptoms, complicating the clinical diagnosis. Individuals with a growing number of the so-called rare disorders exhibit unique, disorder-specific DNA methylation patterns, consequent to the underlying gene defects. Besides providing insights to the pathophysiology and molecular biology of these disorders, we can use these epigenetic patterns as functional biomarkers for the screening and diagnosis of these conditions. This review summarizes our current understanding of DNA methylation episignatures in rare disorders and describes the underlying technology and analytical approaches. We discuss the computational parameters, including statistical and machine learning methods, used for the screening and classification of genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance. Describing the rationale and principles applied to the specific computational models that are used to develop and adapt the DNA methylation episignatures for the diagnosis of rare disorders, we highlight the opportunities and challenges in this emerging branch of diagnostic medicine.

Abstract: The challenges and ambiguities in providing an accurate diagnosis for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders have led researchers to apply epigenetics as a technique to validate the diagnosis provided based on the clinical examination and genetic testing results. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has recently been adapted for clinical testing of patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In this paper, preliminary data demonstrating a DNA methylation signature for Renpenning syndrome (RENS1 – OMIM 309500), which is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is reported. The identified episignature was then utilized to construct a highly sensitive and specific binary classification model. Besides providing evidence for the existence of a DNA methylation episignature for Renpenning syndrome, this study increases the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to the disease. Moreover, the availability of more subjects in future may facilitate the establishment of an episignature that can be utilized for diagnosis in a clinical setting and for reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance.

Abstract: A growing number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders are known to be associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns, called episignatures, which are detectable in peripheral blood. The intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic, Armfield type (MRXSA) is caused by missense variants in FAM50A. Functional studies revealed the pathogenesis to be a spliceosomopathy that is characterized by atypical mRNA processing during development. In this study, we assessed the peripheral blood specimens in a cohort of individuals with MRXSA and detected a unique and highly specific DNA methylation episignature associated with this disorder. We used this episignature to construct a support vector machine model capable of sensitive and specific identification of individuals with pathogenic variants in FAM50A. This study contributes to the expanding number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with defined DNA methylation episignatures, provides an additional understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms, and further enhances our ability to diagnose patients with rare disorders.

Abstract: Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by short stature, delayed osseous maturation, expressive language impairment, and unique facial dysmorphology. We previously identified mutations in the chromatin remodeling protein SRCAP (SNF2-related CBP Activator Protein) as the cause of FHS. SRCAP has multiple roles in chromatin and transcriptional regulation; however, specific epigenetic consequences of SRCAP mutations remain to be described. Using high resolution genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, we identified a unique and highly specific DNA methylation "epi-signature" in the peripheral blood of individuals with FHS. Both hyper and hypomethylated loci are distributed across the genome, preferentially occurring in CpG islands. Clonal bisulfite sequencing of two hypermethylated (FIGN and STPG2) and two hypomethylated (MYO1F and RASIP1) genes confirmed these findings. The identification of a unique methylation signature in FHS provides further insight into the biological function of SRCAP and provides a unique biomarker for this disorder.

Abstract: Verheij syndrome [VRJS; OMIM 615583] is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinct clinical features, including growth retardation, intellectual disability, cardiac, and renal anomalies. VRJS is caused by deletions of chromosome 8q24.3 or pathogenic variants in the PUF60 gene. Recently, pathogenic PUF60 variants have been reported in some individuals with VRJS, contributing to the variability in the clinical presentation and severity of the condition. PUF60 encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and cellular growth. In this report, we describe a new case of VRJS with developmental delay, cardiac-, and renal abnormalities, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic PUF60 variant. Surprisingly, DNA methylation analysis revealed a pattern resembling the Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) episignature, suggesting a potential connection between PUF60 and CdLS-related genes. This case report further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of VRJS and supports further research to validate the interaction between VRJS and CdLS.

Abstract: We investigated gene-environment effects on structural brain endophenotype in bipolar disorder (BD) using a novel method of combining polygenic risk scores with epigenetic signatures since traditional methods of examining the family history and trauma effects have significant limitations. The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stress contributes to premature aging and susceptibility to alcohol use disorder (AUD), and AUD itself is a factor in premature aging; however, the interrelationships of stress, AUD, and premature aging are poorly understood. METHODS: We constructed a composite score of stress from 13 stress-related outcomes in a discovery cohort of 317 individuals with AUD and control subjects. We then developed a novel methylation score of stress (MS stress) as a proxy of composite score of stress comprising 211 CpGs selected using a penalized regression model. The effects of MS stress on health outcomes and epigenetic aging were assessed in a sample of 615 patients with AUD and control subjects using epigenetic clocks and DNA methylation-based telomere length. Statistical analysis with an additive model using MS stress and a MS for alcohol consumption (MS alcohol) was conducted. Results were replicated in 2 independent cohorts (Generation Scotland, N = 7028 and the Grady Trauma Project, N = 795). RESULTS: Composite score of stress and MS stress were strongly associated with heavy alcohol consumption, trauma experience, epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), and shortened DNA methylation-based telomere length in AUD. Together, MS stress and MS alcohol additively showed strong stepwise increases in EAA. Replication analyses showed robust association between MS stress and EAA in the Generation Scotland and Grady Trauma Project cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A methylation-derived score tracking stress exposure is associated with various stress-related phenotypes and EAA. Stress and alcohol have additive effects on aging, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of premature aging in AUD and, potentially, other aspects of gene dysregulation in this disorder.

Abstract: Features of the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) may overlap with other entities characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, making clinical diagnosis often ambiguous. Numerous scoring systems have been continuously modified, based on anthropometric parameters, dysmorphic features and health issues, including growth and gastrointestinal disturbances. Clinical criteria serve for screening patients for further genetic tests. The latter include tests for analyzing DNA methylation of 11p15 loci and multilocus methylation/imprinting defects (MLMD/MLID). Other techniques useful for SRS diagnosis include analysis for maternal uniparental disomy (UPD(7)mat) and molecular karyotypying if submicroscopic imbalances are suspected. The recurrence risk of SRS within a family is generally estimated low; rare familial cases depend on influence of additional genetic mechanisms. Children with SRS should be under multidisciplinary care. Failure to thrive or gastroesophageal reflux require careful estimation of caloric intake and composition of foods by a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist. Growth and puberty should be followed by an endocrinologist, and treatment with recombinant or biosimilar growth hormone is available for children with SRS. Speech and physiotherapists, psychologists and neurologists are involved in management of psychomotor development. Studies in genetically confirmed cohorts of children with SRS are necessary to evaluate long-term developmental outcome and metabolic sequelae, particularly carbohydrate disturbances in this group of patients.

Abstract: Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important etiological mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Pathogenic variation in epigenetic regulators can impair deposition of histone post-translational modifications leading to aberrant spatiotemporal gene expression during neurodevelopment. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a prominent multi-subunit epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is responsible for histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). Using exome sequencing, here we identify a cohort of 25 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants in MSL complex member MSL2. MSL2 variants were associated with NDD phenotypes including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and motor issues such as coordination problems, feeding difficulties, and gait disturbance. Dysmorphisms and behavioral and/or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and to a lesser extent, seizures, connective tissue disease signs, sleep disturbance, vision problems, and other organ anomalies, were observed in affected individuals. As a molecular biomarker, a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature has been established. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from three members of our cohort exhibited reduced MSL2 levels. Remarkably, while NDD-associated variants in two other members of the MSL complex (MOF and MSL3) result in reduced H4K16ac, global H4K16ac levels are unchanged in iPSCs with MSL2 variants. Regardless, MSL2 variants altered the expression of MSL2 targets in iPSCs and upon their differentiation to early germ layers. Our study defines an MSL2-related disorder as an NDD with distinguishable clinical features, a specific blood DNA episignature, and a distinct, MSL2-specific molecular etiology compared to other MSL complex-related disorders.

Abstract: Purpose: The main objective of this study was to assess clinical features and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in individuals affected by intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 21 (IDD21) syndrome, caused by variants in the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) gene. Methods: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood of 16 individuals with clinical features and genetic findings consistent with IDD21. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip microarrays. The methylation levels were fitted in a multivariate linear regression model to identify the differentially methylated probes. A binary support vector machine classification model was constructed to differentiate IDD21 samples from controls. Results: We identified a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive episignature associated with CTCF variants. Six variants of uncertain significance were tested, of which 2 mapped to the IDD21 episignature and clustered alongside IDD21 cases in both heatmap and multidimensional scaling plots. Comparison of the genomic DNA methylation profile of IDD21 with that of 56 other neurodevelopmental disorders provided insights into the underlying molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. Conclusion: The robust and specific CTCF/IDD21 episignature expands the growing list of neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct DNA methylation profiles, which can be applied as supporting evidence in variant classification.

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations in either KMT2D on chromosome 12 or KDM6A on chromosome X, encoding a lysine methyltransferase and a lysine demethylase, respectively. A 9-year-4-month-old male patient with a normal karyotype presented with KS and autism spectrum disorder. Genetic testing for KS was conducted by Sanger sequencing and episignature analysis using DNA methylation array data. The patient had a mosaic stop-gain variant in KDM6A and a heterozygous missense variant (rs201078160) in KMT2D. The KDM6A variant is expected to be deleterious. The KMT2D variant pathogenicity has been inconsistently reported in the ClinVar database. Using biobanking resources, we identified two heterozygous individuals possessing the rs201078160 variant. In a subsequent episignature analysis, the KS patient showed the KS episignature, but two control individuals with the rs201078160 variant did not. Our results indicate that the mosaic stop-gained variant in KDM6A, but not the rs201078160 variant in KMT2D, is responsible for the KS phenotype in the patient. This study further demonstrated the utility of DNA methylation information in diagnosing rare genetic diseases and emphasized the importance of a reference dataset containing both genotype and DNA methylation information.

Abstract: Purpose of ReviewEnormous progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture of obesity and the correlation of epigenetic marks with obesity and related traits. This review highlights current research and its challenges in genetics and epigenetics of obesity.Recent FindingsRecent progress in genetics of polygenic traits, particularly represented by genome-wide association studies, led to the discovery of hundreds of genetic variants associated with obesity, which allows constructing polygenic risk scores (PGS). In addition, epigenome-wide association studies helped identifying novel targets and methylation sites being important in the pathophysiology of obesity and which are essential for the generation of methylation risk scores (MRS). Despite their great potential for predicting the individual risk for obesity, the use of PGS and MRS remains challenging.SummaryFuture research will likely discover more loci being involved in obesity, which will contribute to better understanding of the complex etiology of human obesity. The ultimate goal from a clinical perspective will be generating highly robust and accurate prediction scores allowing clinicians to predict obesity as well as individual responses to body weight loss-specific life-style interventions.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the diagnostic utility and provide reporting recommendations for clinical DNA methylation episignature testing based on the cohort of patients tested through the EpiSign Clinical Testing Network. METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epigenomic (e.g., DNA methylation [DNAm]) changes have been hypothesized as intermediate step linking environmental exposures with allergic disease. Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

Abstract: Background: DNA methylation (DNAm) is considered a plausible pathway through which genetic and environmental factors may influence the development of allergies. However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization. Conclusion: The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.

Abstract: Imprinted genes are regulated by DNA methylation of imprinted differentially methylated regions (iDMRs). An increasing number of patients with congenital imprinting disorders (IDs) exhibit aberrant methylation at multiple imprinted loci, multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). We examined MLID and its possible impact on clinical features in patients with IDs. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis (GWMA) using blood leukocyte DNA was performed on 13 patients with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), two patients with Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS), and four controls. HumanMethylation850 BeadChip analysis for 77 iDMRs (809 CpG sites) identified three patients with BWS and one patient with SRS showing additional hypomethylation, other than the disease-related iDMRs, suggestive of MLID. Two regions were aberrantly methylated in at least two patients with BWS showing MLID: PPIEL locus (chromosome 1: 39559298 to 39559744), and FAM50B locus (chromosome 6: 3849096 to 3849469). All patients with BWS- and SRS-MLID did not show any other clinical characteristics associated with additional involved iDMRs. Exome analysis in three patients with BWS who exhibited multiple hypomethylation did not identify any causative variant related to MLID. This study indicates that a genome-wide approach can unravel MLID in patients with an apparently isolated ID. Patients with MLID showed only clinical features related to the original IDs. Long-term follow-up studies in larger cohorts are warranted to evaluate any possible phenotypic consequences of other disturbed imprinted loci.

Abstract: Genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants and differentially methylated nucleotides associated with childhood asthma. Incorporation of such genomic data may improve performance of childhood asthma prediction models which use phenotypic and environmental data. Using genome-wide genotype and methylation data at birth from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n = 1456), a polygenic risk score (PRS), and newborn (nMRS) and childhood (cMRS) methylation risk scores, were developed to predict childhood asthma diagnosis. Each risk score was integrated with two previously published childhood asthma prediction models (CAPE and CAPP) and were validated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study. Individually, the genomic risk scores demonstrated modest-to-moderate discriminative performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC: PRS = 0.64, nMRS = 0.55, cMRS = 0.54), and their integration only marginally improved the performance of the CAPE (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.71) and CAPP models (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.82). The limited predictive performance of each genomic risk score individually and their inability to substantially improve upon the performance of the CAPE and CAPP models suggests that genetic and epigenetic predictors of the broad phenotype of asthma are unlikely to have clinical utility. Hence, further studies predicting specific asthma endotypes are warranted.

Abstract: SETD1B is a component of a histone methyltransferase complex that specifically methylates Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3K4) and is responsible for the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. De novo microdeletions encompassing this gene as well as de novo missense mutations were previously linked to syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Here, we identify a specific hypermethylation signature associated with loss of function mutations in the SETD1B gene which may be used as an epigenetic marker supporting the diagnosis of syndromic SETD1B-related diseases. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this unique epi-signature by reclassifying previously identified SETD1B VUS (variant of uncertain significance) in two patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review demonstrates the growing body of evidence connecting DNA methylation to prior exposure. It highlights the potential to use DNA methylation patterns as a feasible, stable, and accurate biomarker of past exposure, opening new opportunities for environmental and gene-environment interaction studies among existing banked samples. RECENT FINDINGS: We present the evidence for association between past exposure, including prenatal exposures, and DNA methylation measured at a later time in the life course. We demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation-based biomarkers of past exposure using results from multiple studies of smoking as an example. Multiple studies show the ability to accurately predict prenatal smoking exposure based on DNA methylation measured at birth, in childhood, and even adulthood. Separate sets of DNA methylation loci have been used to predict past personal smoking exposure (postnatal) as well. Further, it appears that these two types of exposures, prenatal and previous personal exposure, can be isolated from each other. There is also a suggestion that quantitative methylation scores may be useful for estimating dose. We highlight the remaining needs for rigor in methylation biomarker development including analytic challenges as well as the need for development across multiple developmental windows, multiple tissue types, and multiple ancestries. SUMMARY: If fully developed, DNA methylation-based biomarkers can dramatically shift our ability to carry out environmental and genetic-environmental epidemiology using existing biobanks, opening up unprecedented opportunities for environmental health.

Abstract: Sequence-based genetic testing currently identifies causative genetic variants in ~50% of individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations (“epivariants”) can drive disease by modulating gene expression at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can result in distinct “episignature” biomarkers for monogenic disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10 individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2 using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ~2% (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases.

Abstract: Childhood obesity represents a significant global health concern and identifying its risk factors is crucial for developing intervention programs. Many "omics" factors associated with the risk of developing obesity have been identified, including genomic, microbiomic, and epigenomic factors. Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F, and PPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early-life nutritional exposures may contribute to offspring epigenetic modifications. However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). OBJECTIVES: We aim to fill this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation cohort. METHODS: Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear regressions, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, whose functions involve regulation of bone development (beta = -0.0036, per 1 point increase in the score; P = 5.6 x 10-8). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell signaling gene LUZP1 (beta = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 x 10-8). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Parental dietary quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of parental nutritional programming is warranted. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Methylation-specific (MS) multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) at two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at chromosome 11p15, H19-DMR and LIT1-DMR, and microsatellite analysis for uniparental disomy (UPD) at chromosome 7 or 11, have been recommended for the genetic diagnosis of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). In this study, the efficacy of the MS pyrosequencing method at H19-DMR and LIT1-DMR at 11p15 and SGCE-DMR at 7q21 was evaluated for the genetic diagnosis of BWS (n=18) and SRS (n=20) patients. Epigenetic alterations or UPD were detected in 83% of BWS and 50% of SRS individuals by MS-MLPA, but the detection rate increased to 95% of BWS and 70% of SRS by MS pyrosequencing. Thirteen BWS patients (72%) harbored loss-of-methylation (LOM) at LIT1-DMR and two patients (11%) harbored gain-of-methylation (GOM) at H19-DMR, whereas two patients (11%) had both LOM at LIT1-DMR and GOM at H19-DMR, reflecting paternal UPD 11. Thirteen SRS patients (65%) harbored LOM at H19-DMR, whereas one patient (5%) had GOM at SGCE-DMR, reflecting maternal UPD 7. Birth anthropometric profiles were significantly correlated to methylation scores at either H19-DMR or LIT1-DMR. In conclusion, MS pyrosequencing enhanced the detection rate of molecular defects in BWS and SRS. Moreover, it indicates that methylation status at 11p15.5 might have an important role in fetal growth.

Abstract: Germline pathogenic variants in two genes encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase genes SETD1A and SETD2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) characterized by developmental delay and congenital anomalies. The SETD1A and SETD2 gene products play a critical role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Specific methylation episignatures have been detected for a range of chromatin gene-related NDDs and have impacted clinical practice by improving the interpretation of variant pathogenicity. To investigate if SETD1A and/or SETD2-related NDDs are associated with a detectable episignature, we undertook targeted genome-wide methylation profiling of > 2 M CpGs using a next-generation sequencing-based assay. A comparison of methylation profiles in patients with SETD1A variants (n = 6) did not reveal evidence of a strong methylation episignature. A review of the clinical and genetic features of the SETD2 patient group revealed that, as reported previously, there were phenotypic differences between patients with truncating mutations (n = 4, Luscan-Lumish syndrome; MIM:616831) and those with missense codon 1740 variants [p.Arg1740Trp (n = 4) and p.Arg1740Gln (n = 2)]. Both SETD2 subgroups demonstrated a methylation episignature, which was characterized by hypomethylation and hypermethylation events, respectively. Within the codon 1740 subgroup, both the methylation changes and clinical phenotype were more severe in those with p.Arg1740Trp variants. We also noted that two of 10 cases with a SETD2NDD had developed a neoplasm. These findings reveal novel epigenotype–genotype–phenotype correlations in SETD2-NDDs and predict a gain-of-function mechanism for SETD2 codon 1740 pathogenic variants.

Abstract: HNRNPU encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays critical roles in regulating pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Aberrant expression and dysregulation of HNRNPU have been implicated in various human diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. We applied a next generation sequencing based assay (EPIC-NGS) to investigate genome-wide methylation profiling for >2 M CpGs for 7 individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with HNRNPU germline pathogenic loss-of-function variants. Compared to healthy individuals, 227 HNRNPU-associated differentially methylated positions were detected. Both hyper- and hypomethylation alterations were identified but the former predominated. The identification of a methylation episignature for HNRNPU-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) implicates HNPRNPU-related chromatin alterations in the aetiopathogenesis of this disorder and suggests that episignature profiling should have clinical utility as a predictor for the pathogenicity of HNRNPU variants of uncertain significance. The detection of a methylation episignaure for HNRNPU-associated NDD is consistent with a recent report of a methylation episignature for HNRNPK-associated NDD.

Abstract: Aim & methods: To investigate peripheral blood methylation episignatures in KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT-KMT2B), the authors undertook genome-wide methylation profiling of ~2 M CpGs using a next-generation sequencing-based assay and compared the findings with those in controls and patients with KMT2D-related Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1). Results: A total of 1812 significantly differentially methylated CpG positions (false discovery rate < 0.05) were detected in DYT-KMT2B samples compared with controls. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis showed that the 10 DYT-KMT2B samples clustered together and separately from 29 controls and 10 with pathogenic variants in KMT2D. The authors found that most differentially methylated CpG positions were specific to one disorder and that all (DYT-KMT2B) and most (Kabuki syndrome type 1) methylation alterations in CpG islands were gain of methylation events. Conclusion: Using sensitive methylation profiling methodology, the authors replicated recent reports of a methylation episignature for DYT-KMT2B. These findings will facilitate the development of episignature-based assays to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Common obesity is widely regarded as a complex, multifactorial trait influenced by the 'obesogenic' environment, sedentary behavior, and genetic susceptibility contributed by common and rare genetic variants. This review describes the recent advances in understanding the role of genetics in obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: New susceptibility loci and genetic variants are being uncovered, but the collective effect is relatively small and could not explain most of the BMI heritability. Yet-to-be identified common and rare variants, epistasis, and heritable epigenetic changes may account for part of the 'missing heritability'. Evidence is emerging about the role of epigenetics in determining obesity susceptibility, mediating developmental plasticity, which confers obesity risk from early life experiences. Genetic prediction scores derived from selected genetic variants, and also differential DNA methylation levels and methylation scores, have been shown to correlate with measures of obesity and response to weight loss intervention. Genetic variants, which confer susceptibility to obesity-related morbidities like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, were also discovered recently. SUMMARY: We can expect discovery of more rare genetic variants with the advent of whole exome and genome sequencing, and also greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by which environment influences genetic expression and which mediate the gene-environment interaction.

Abstract: TET3 encodes an essential dioxygenase involved in epigenetic regulation through DNA demethylation. TET3 deficiency, or Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS; MIM: 618798), is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder of the DNA demethylation machinery with a nonspecific phenotype resembling other chromatin-modifying disorders, but inconsistent variant types and inheritance patterns pose diagnostic challenges. Given TET3’s direct role in regulating 5-methylcytosine and recent identification of syndrome-specific DNA methylation profiles, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood of TET3-deficient individuals and identified an episignature that distinguishes affected and unaffected individuals and those with mono-allelic and bi-allelic pathogenic variants. Validation and testing of the episignature correctly categorized known TET3 variants and determined pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. Clinical utility was demonstrated when the episignature alone identified an affected individual from over 1000 undiagnosed cases and was confirmed upon distinguishing TET3-deficient individuals from those with 46 other disorders. The TET3-deficient signature - and the signature resulting from activating mutations in DNMT1 which normally opposes TET3 - are characterized by hypermethylation, which for BEFAHRS involves CpG sites that may be biologically relevant. This work expands the role of epi-phenotyping in molecular diagnosis and reveals genome-wide DNA methylation profiling as a quantitative, functional readout for characterization of this new biochemical category of disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Three DNA methylation (DNAm) based algorithms, DNAm PhenoAge acceleration (AgeAccelPheno), DNAm GrimAge acceleration (AgeAccelGrim), and mortality risk score (MRscore), based on methylation in 513, 1030, and 10 CpGs, respectively, were established to predict health outcomes and mortality. We aimed to compare and validate the predictive ability of these scores and frailty in relation to mortality in a population-based cohort from Germany. METHODS: DNA methylation in whole blood was measured by the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit (EPIC, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in two random subsets of the ESTHER cohort study (n = 741 and n = 1030). AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and a revised MRscore to adapt EPIC, the MRscore with 8 CpGs (MRscore-8CpGs), were calculated. Frailty was assessed by a frailty index (FI). FINDINGS: During 17 years of follow-up, 458 deaths were observed. All DNAm algorithms and FI were positively correlated with each other. AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, MRscore, and FI showed independent associations with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (95% CI) per SD increase = 1.32 (1.19-1.46), 1.47 (1.32-1.64), 1.73 (1.49-2.01), and 1.31 (1.20-1.43), respectively]. Harrell's C-statistic was 0.710 for a model predicting mortality by age, sex, and leukocyte composition and increased to 0.759 in a model including MRscore-8CpGs and FI. The predictive performance was further improved (Harrell's C-statistic = 0.766) when additionally including AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim into the model. INTERPRETATION: The combination of a DNA methylation score based on 8 CpGs only and an easy to ascertain frailty index may strongly enhance mortality prediction beyond age and sex. FUNDING: The ESTHER study was funded by grants from the Baden-Wurttemberg state Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (Stuttgart, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Berlin, Germany), and the Saarland State Ministry of Health, Social Affairs, Women and the Family (Saarbrucken, Germany).

Abstract: De novo, truncating variants of ASXL1 cause two distinct disorders: Bohring-Opitz Syndrome (BOS, OMIM #605039) a rare pediatric disorder characterized by multiorgan anomalies that disrupt normal brain, heart, and bone development causing severe intellectual disability or are somatic driver mutations causing acute myeloid leukemia(AML). Despite their distinct clinical presentations, we propose that ASXL1 mutations drive common epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in BOS and AML. We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA-seq data from BOS patients (n=13) and controls (n=38) and publicly available DNAm of AML cases with (n=3) and without (n=3) ASXL1 mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and RNA-seq data from AML cases (n=27) from the Beat AML cohort. Using a DNA-methylation based episignature that we previously developed for BOS, we clustered AML, BOS and normal controls together. We showed that AML samples with ASXL1 mutations clustered closest to individuals with BOS, whereas individuals with AML without ASXL1 mutations clustered separately. We also observe common dysregulation of the transcriptome between BOS and AML with ASXL1 mutations compared to controls. Our transcriptomic analysis identified 821 significantly differentially expressed genes that were shared between both data sets and 74.9% showed differential expression in the same direction. BOS patients are rare and have some reports of tumors but no clear guidelines on cancer screening protocols. This represents the first direct comparison between distinct diseases that show common epigenetic and transcriptomic effects, and potentially common drug targets for patients harboring ASXL1 mutations on the epigenome and transcriptome.

Abstract: Background. Increasing evidence has shown that tumorigenesis correlates with aberrant epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, RNA m6A modification, RNA binding proteins, and transcription factors. However, it is unclear that how epigenetic genes linked with alteration contribute to osteosarcoma's incidence and clinical prognosis. We developed an epigenetic modification-related prognostic model that may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma. Methods. We investigated the epigenetic modification-associated genes and their clinical significance in osteosarcoma in this research. Our gene transcriptome data were obtained from the TARGET database and the GEO database. Bioinformatics techniques were used to investigate their functionalities. The diagnostic and prognostic models were constructed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. In addition, we developed a nomogram indicating the practicability of the prognostic model described above. Results. A risk score model constructed based on four epigenetic modification-related genes (MYC, TERT, EIF4E3, and RBM34) can effectively predict the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma. Based on the risk score and clinical features, we constructed a nomogram. Conclusion. Epigenetic modification-related genes have been identified as important prognostic markers that may assist in osteosarcoma therapy therapeutic decision-making.

Abstract: The group of CNS mesenchymal (non-meningothelial) and primary glial/neuronal tumors in association with EWSR1-non-ETS rearrangements comprises a growing spectrum of entities, mostly reported in isolation with incomplete molecular profiling. Archival files from three pediatric institutions were queried for unusual cases of pediatric (<=21 years) CNS EWSR1-rearranged tumors confirmed by at least one molecular technique. Extra-axial tumors and cases with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1-ETS family fusions) were excluded. Additional studies, including anchored multiplex-PCR with next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, were performed as needed to determine fusion partner status and brain tumor methylation class, respectively. Five cases (median 17 years) were identified (M:F of 3:2). Location was parenchymal (n = 3) and undetermined (n = 2) with topographic distributions including posterior fossa (n = 1), frontal (n = 1), temporal (n = 1), parietal (n = 1) and occipital (n = 1) lobes. Final designation with fusion findings included desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWSR1-WT1; n = 1) and tumors of uncertain histogenesis (EWSR1-CREM, n = 1; EWSR1-CREB1, n = 1; EWSR1-PLAGL1, n = 1; and EWSR1-PATZ1, n = 1). Tumors showed a wide spectrum of morphology and biologic behavior. For EWSR1-CREM, EWSR1-PLAGL1 and EWSR1-PATZ1 tumors, no significant methylation scores were reached in the known brain tumor classes. Available outcome (4/5) was reported as favorable (n = 2) and unfavorable (n = 2) with a median follow-up of 30 months. In conclusion, we describe five primary EWSR1-non-ETS fused CNS tumors exhibiting morphologic and biologic heterogeneity and we highlight the clinical importance of determining specific fusion partners to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment and monitoring. Larger prospective clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of histotypes, anatomical location, fusion partners, breakpoints and methylation profiles in patients with these rare tumors.

Abstract: Partial duplications of genes can be challenging to detect and interpret and, therefore, likely represent an underreported cause of human disease. X-linked dominant variants in ATRX are associated with Alpha-thalassemia/impaired intellectual development syndrome, X-linked (ATR-X syndrome), a clinically heterogeneous disease generally presenting with intellectual disability, hypotonia, characteristic facies, genital anomalies, and alpha-thalassemia. We describe an affected male with a de novo hemizygous intragenic duplication of ~43.6 kb in ATRX, detected by research genome sequencing following non-diagnostic clinical testing. RNA sequencing and DNA methylation episignature analyses were central in variant interpretation, and this duplication was subsequently interpreted as disease-causing. This represents the smallest reported tandem duplication within ATRX associated with disease. This case demonstrates the diagnostic utility of integrating multiple omics technologies, which can ultimately lead to a definitive diagnosis for rare disease patients.

Abstract: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is an established major risk factor for a number of negative health outcomes later in life. While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures. This study highlights the importance of mapping not only of the epigenome but also the exposome and extending the observational timeframe to well before birth. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is caused by deletion of a critical region of the short arm of chromosome 4. Clinical features of WHS include distinct dysmorphic facial features, growth restriction, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other malformations. The NSD2 gene localizes within this critical region along with several other genes. Pathogenic variants in NSD2 cause Rauch-Steindl (RAUST) syndrome. Clinical features of RAUST syndrome partially overlap with WHS, however epilepsy and the recognizable facial gestalt are not observed. Here, we report a case of a young boy who presented with developmental delay, dysmorphic features and short stature. After negative chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing, genomic DNA methylation episignature analysis was performed. Episignatures are sensitive and specific genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with a growing number of rare disorders. The patient was positive for the WHS episignature. Reanalysis of the patient's exome data identified a previously undetected frameshift variant in NSD2, leading to a diagnosis of RAUST. This report demonstrates the clinical utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for unresolved patients, and provides insight into the overlapping pathology between WHS and RAUST as demonstrated by the similarities in their genomic DNA methylation profiles.

Abstract: Background: Epigenetic scores (EpiScores), reflecting DNA methylation (DNAm)-based surrogates for complex traits, have been developed for multiple circulating proteins. EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is over-represented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. Results: 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates |0.14 to 0.88|, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates |0.06 to 0.13|, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). In a preterm sub-group (n=217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. Conclusions: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion mainly occur in adults, display pathological features of glioblastomas (GB) and are usually classified as glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them. METHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score > 0.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (< 40), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (> 40), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated. Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age < 40 and lack of TERT promoter mutation. CONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients' risk.

Abstract: Undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas are a group of diagnostically challenging tumors in the pediatric population. Molecular techniques are instrumental for the categorization and differential diagnosis of these tumors. A subgroup of recently identified soft tissue sarcomas with undifferentiated round cell morphology was characterized by Capicua transcriptional receptor (CIC) rearrangements. Recently, an array‐based DNA methylation analysis of undifferentiated tumors with small blue round cell histology was shown to provide a highly robust and reproducible approach for precisely classifying this diagnostically challenging group of tumors. We describe the case of an undifferentiated sarcoma of the abdominal wall in a 12‐year‐old girl. The patient presented with a voluminous mass of the abdominal wall, and multiple micro‐nodules in the right lung. The tumor was unclassifiable with current immunohistochemical and molecular approaches. However, DNA methylation profiling allowed us to classify this neoplasia as small blue round cell tumor with CIC alterations. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. After 22 months, the patient is disease‐free and in good clinical condition. To put our experience in context, we conducted a literature review, analyzing current knowledge and state‐of‐the‐art diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of CIC rearranged sarcomas. Our findings further support the use of DNA methylation profiling as an important tool to improve diagnosis of non‐Ewing small round cell tumors.

Abstract: Dystonia is a prevalent, heterogeneous movement disorder characterized by involuntarily abnormal postures. Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites, which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1× log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (P = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance - thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity. Similarly, it may also function in monitoring the recently envisioned treatment of KMT2B deficiency by inhibition of DNA methylation.

Abstract: In recent years, epigenetic markers emerged as a new tool to understand the influence of lifestyle factors on obesity phenotypes. Adolescence is considered an important epigenetic window over a human's lifetime. The objective of this work was to explore baseline changes in DNA methylation that could be associated with a better weight loss response after a multidisciplinary intervention program in Spanish obese or overweight adolescents. Overweight or obese adolescents (n=107) undergoing 10 wk of a multidisciplinary intervention for weight loss were assigned as high or low responders to the treatment. A methylation microarray was performed to search for baseline epigenetic differences between the 2 groups (12 subjects/group), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to validate (n=107) relevant CpG sites and surrounding regions. After validation, 5 regions located in or near AQP9, DUSP22, HIPK3, TNNT1, and TNNI3 genes showed differential methylation levels between high and low responders to the multidisciplinary weight loss intervention. Moreover, a calculated methylation score was significantly associated with changes in weight, BMI-SDS, and body fat mass loss after the treatment. In summary, we have identified 5 DNA regions that are differentially methylated depending on weight loss response. These methylation changes may help to better understand the weight loss response in obese adolescents.

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome is a Mendelian disorder of the epigenetic machinery characterized by typical dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, and postnatal growth deficiency. Pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the chromatin modifiers KMT2D and KDM6A are responsible for Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) and Kabuki syndrome 2 (KS2), respectively. In addition, 11 cases of KS1 caused by mosaic variants in KMT2D have been reported in the literature. Some of these individuals display milder craniofacial and growth phenotypes, and most do not have congenital heart defects. We report the case of an infant with severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral atresia and aortic atresia (HLHS MA-AA), pulmonary vein stenosis, and atypical facies with a somatic mosaic de novo nonsense variant in KMT2D (c.8200C>T, p.R2734*) identified on trio exome sequencing of peripheral blood and present in 11.2% of sequencing reads. KS was confirmed with EpiSign, a diagnostic genome-wide DNA methylation platform used to identify epigenetic signatures. This case suggests that use of this newly available clinical test can guide the interpretation of low-level mosaic variants identified through sequencing and suggests a new lower limit of mosaicism in whole blood required for a diagnosis of KS.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell cancer with poor survival, characterized by the clonal expansion of multiple myeloma cells (MMC), primarily in the bone marrow. Novel compounds are currently tested in this disease, but partial or minor patients' responses are observed for most compounds used as a single agent. The design of predictors for drug efficacy could be most useful to better understand basic mechanisms targeted by these drugs and design clinical trials. In the current study, we report the building of a DNA methylation score (DM score) predicting the efficacy of decitabine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), targeting methylation-regulated gene expression. DMscore was built by identifying 47 genes regulated by decitabine in human myeloma cell lines and the expression of which in primary MMCs of previously untreated patients is predictive for overall survival. A high DM score predicts patients' poor survival, and, of major interest, high sensitivity of primary MMCs or human myeloma cell lines to decitabine in vitro. Thus, DMscore could be useful to design novel treatments with DMNT inhibitor in multiple myeloma and has highlighted 47 genes, the gene products of which could be important for multiple myeloma disease development.

Abstract: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for most children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Novel therapies controlling the disorder prior to HSCT are needed. We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and antileukemic activity of azacitidine monotherapy prior to HSCT in newly diagnosed JMML patients. Eighteen patients enrolled from September 2015 to November 2017 were treated with azacitidine (75 mg/m2) administered IV once daily on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was the number of patients with clinical complete remission (cCR) or clinical partial remission (cPR) after 3 cycles of therapy. Pharmacokinetics, genome-wide DNA-methylation levels, and variant allele frequencies of leukemia-specific index mutations were also analyzed. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles and 5 patients completed 6 cycles. After 3 cycles, 11 patients (61%) were in cPR and 7 (39%) had progressive disease. Six of 16 patients (38%) who needed platelet transfusions were transfusion-free after 3 cycles. All 7 patients with intermediate- or low-methylation signatures in genome-wide DNA-methylation studies achieved cPR. Seventeen patients received HSCT; 14 (82%) were leukemia-free at a median follow-up of 23.8 months (range, 7.0-39.3 months) after HSCT. Azacitidine was well tolerated and plasma concentration-time profiles were similar to observed profiles in adults. In conclusion, azacitidine monotherapy is a suitable option for children with newly diagnosed JMML. Although long-term safety and efficacy remain to be fully elucidated in this population, these data demonstrate that azacitidine provides valuable clinical benefit to JMML patients prior to HSCT. This trial was registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02447666.

Abstract: There is substantial variation between humans in aggressive behavior, with its biological etiology and molecular genetic basis mostly unknown. This review chapter offers an overview of genomic and omics studies revealing the genetic contribution to aggression and first insights into associations with epigenetic and other omics (e.g., metabolomics) profiles. We allowed for a broad phenotype definition including studies on "aggression," "aggressive behavior," or "aggression-related traits," "antisocial behavior," "conduct disorder," and "oppositional defiant disorder." Heritability estimates based on family and twin studies in children and adults of this broadly defined phenotype of aggression are around 50%, with relatively small fluctuations around this estimate. Next, we review the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which search for associations with alleles and also allow for gene-based tests and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) which seek to identify associations with differently methylated regions across the genome. Both GWAS and EWAS allow for construction of Polygenic and DNA methylation scores at an individual level. Currently, these predict a small percentage of variance in aggression. We expect that increases in sample size will lead to additional discoveries in GWAS and EWAS, and that multiomics approaches will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of aggression.

Abstract: We examined the performance of methylation scores (MS) and polygenic scores (PGS) for birth weight, BMI, prenatal maternal smoking exposure, and smoking status to assess the extent to which MS could predict these traits and exposures over and above the PGS in a multi-omics prediction model. MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

Abstract: DNA methylation classifiers (“episignatures”) help to determine the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.

Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD) are prevalent anxiety disorders characterized by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Both disorders share overlapping features and often coexist, despite displaying distinct characteristics. Childhood life adversity, overall stressful life events, and genetic factors contribute to the development of these disorders. DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, we investigated whether whole-genome DNA methylation risk scores (MRSs) for SAD risk, severity of social anxiety, childhood life adversity, PD risk, and overall stressful life events were associated with SAD or PD case-control status. Preliminary epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) for SAD risk, severity of social anxiety, and childhood life adversity were conducted in 66 SAD individuals and 77 healthy controls (HCs). Similarly, EWASs for PD risk and overall stressful life events were performed in 182 PD individuals and 81 HCs. MRSs were calculated from these EWASs. MRSs derived from the EWASs of SAD risk and severity of social anxiety were greater in PD patients than in HCs. Additionally, MRSs derived from the EWASs of overall stressful life events, particularly in PD individuals, were lower in SAD individuals than in HCs. In contrast, MRSs for childhood life adversity or PD risk were not significantly associated with PD or SAD case-control status. These findings highlight the epigenetic features shared in both disorders and the distinctive epigenetic features related to social avoidance in SAD patients, helping to elucidate the epigenetic basis of these disorders.

Abstract: Age estimation of unidentified bodies is of marked importance in forensic medicine. In previous studies, the analysis of DNA methylation in body fluids led to the identification of several age-related CpG sites in genes such as EDARADD and FHL2. However, limited information is available on whether interethnic differences may affect the age prediction results. In the present study, we examined the effect of ethnicity on the age prediction method based on methylation scores, which were determined via methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting. We found that there was a significant difference in methylation scores between Japanese and Indonesian participants of early 20 s group, and that the nationality coefficient was significant for age estimation when applying the existing method for the analysis of the methylation status of EDARADD and FHL2. This suggests that when using certain biochemical indicators as a predictor of age, the effects of ethnicity on DNA methylation should be considered to improve the accuracy of the estimation.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous cancer-predisposing disorder representing the most common bone marrow failure syndrome. It is caused by inactivating predominantly biallelic mutations involving >20 genes encoding proteins with roles in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Molecular diagnosis of FA is challenging due to the wide spectrum of the contributing gene mutations and structural rearrangements. The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.

Abstract: The search for aetiology of Mendelian disorders is traditionally based on the observation of clinical phenotypes and molecular screening of associated genes. However, a disease-specific diagnosis can be challenging. In this study we detail how the combinatorial genomic and epigenomic assessment allowed to find the underlying molecular event of a clinical case that remained misdiagnosed for years. The individual was referred as affected by an atypical form of Kabuki syndrome with a variant of uncertain significance in the KMT2D gene. However, significant inconsistencies with this diagnosis emerged upon familial segregation of the variant and after the clinical re-evaluation. Therefore, we applied an epigenomic strategy by studying the DNA methylation profile which resulted not consistent with the Kabuki syndrome episignature or with any other disorder-specific episignature described so far, providing strong evidence that the Kabuki syndrome diagnosis does not apply. This result led us to further investigate for epigenetic machinery diseases by using a multigene panel for chromatinopathies. Since this analysis yielded negative results, we applied a whole exome sequencing and identified a de novo pathogenic variant in the CTNNB1 gene associated to NEDSDV syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies. Based on molecular results and the updated clinical features, we confirmed the NEDSDV diagnosis. Our findings show that the combination of genomic and epigenomics strategies, along with a deeper analysis of clinical phenotype, may provide a significant improvement in the diagnostic protocols for rare genetic disorders and help resolve long-time misdiagnosed and unsolved case.

Abstract: Prenatal stress exposure is associated with risk for psychiatric disorders later in life. This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] <= 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression >= 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.

Abstract: In cattle, several calves born after IVP (“in vitro” embryo production) present similar birthweight to those generated after MOET (multiple ovulation and embryo transfer). However, the underlying molecular patterns in organs involved in the developmental process are unknown and could indicate physiological programming. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare epigenomic and transcriptomic modifications in the hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal and adrenal organs between 3 months old ovum pick-up-IVP and MOET male calves (n = 4 per group) and (2) to use blood epigenomic data to proxy methylation of the inner organs. Extracted gDNA and RNA were sequenced through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing, respectively. Next, bioinformatic analyses determined differentially methylated cytosines (DMC) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR < 0.05) in IVP versus MOET samples and the KEGG pathways that were overrepresented by genes associated with DMC or DEG (FDR < 0.1). Pathways related to hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal (HPG) axis activation (GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus, GnRH signaling in the pituitary, and steroidogenesis in the testicle) were enriched in IVP calves. Modeling the effect of the methylation levels and the group on the expression of all the genes involved in these pathways confirmed their upregulation in HPG organs in IVP calves. The application of the DIABLO method allowed the identification of 15 epigenetic and five transcriptomic biomarkers, which were able to predict the embryo origin using the epigenomic data from the blood. In conclusion, the use of an integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic approach suggested an early activation of the HPG axis in male IVP calves compared to MOET counterparts, and the identification of potential biomarkers allowed the use of blood samples to proxy methylation levels of the relevant internal organs.

Abstract: Deletion 1p36 (del1p36) syndrome is the most common human disorder resulting from a terminal autosomal deletion. This condition is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous. Deletions involving two non-overlapping regions, known as the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are sufficient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorphisms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region. Here, we used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to define a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that overlap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. The clinical profile of this disease includes developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention deficit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrow palate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especially in females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co-expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsufficiency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affected females, providing further evidence of a specific contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome-specific episignature that classifies syndromic traits. We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric to the previously established 1p36 critical regions.

Abstract: Children who experience environmental adversities are at increased risk of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the influence of environmental adversities on mental health. We examined the hypothesis that salivary DNA-methylation patterns of pace of biological aging (Dunedin pace of biological aging [DunedinPoAm]) and inflammation (DNA-methylation C-reactive protein [DNAm-CRP]) are socially stratified and associated with mental health in 1,183 children (609 female; age: M = 13.6 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Analyses were preregistered. Participants' DNA-methylation algorithms and psychiatric symptoms differed by socioeconomic contexts and race/ethnicity. Children with more parent-reported internalizing symptoms had higher DunedinPoAm and DNAm-CRP scores, and children with more aggression problems had higher DNAm-CRP. DunedinPoAm partially mediated advantage of White racial identity on internalizing. Likewise, DNAm-CRP partially mediated advantage of higher family socioeconomic contexts and, in a separate model, White racial identity on reduced internalizing symptoms. Children's epigenetic measures of pace of biological aging and inflammation are associated with social inequalities and mental health.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fetal exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the development of noncommunicable diseases in the offspring. Maternal smoking may induce such long-term effects through persistent changes in the DNA methylome, which therefore hold the potential to be used as a biomarker of this early life exposure. With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier ("Reese Score") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is associated with body mass index (BMI), but it is not clear if methylation scores are biomarkers for extant BMI or predictive of future BMI. Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking during pregnancy, especially when sustained, leads to numerous adverse health outcomes in offspring. Pregnant women disproportionately underreport smoking and smokers tend to have lower follow-up rates to repeat questionnaires. Missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data on presence and duration of smoking in pregnancy impairs identification of novel health effects and limits adjustment for smoking in studies of other pregnancy exposures. An objective biomarker in newborns of maternal smoking during pregnancy would be valuable. OBJECTIVES: We developed a biomarker of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy using common DNA methylation platforms. METHODS: Using a dimension reduction method, we developed and tested a numeric score in newborns to reflect sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy from data on cotinine, a short-term smoking biomarker measured mid-pregnancy, and Illumina450K cord blood DNA methylation from newborns in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). RESULTS: This score reliably predicted smoking status in the training set (n = 1,057; accuracy = 96%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 98%). Sensitivity (58%) was predictably lower in the much smaller test set (n = 221), but accuracy (91%) and specificity (97%) remained high. Reduced birth weight, a well-known effect of maternal smoking, was as strongly related to the score as to cotinine. A three-site score had lower, but acceptable, performance (accuracytrain = 82%, accuracytest = 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Our smoking methylation score represents a promising novel biomarker of sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy easily calculated with Illumina450K or IlluminaEPIC data. It may help identify novel health impacts and improve adjustment for smoking when studying other risk factors with more subtle effects.

Abstract: Importance: DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment may have implications for the genome that compromise adult health. Objective: To ascertain whether childhood neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with differences in DNA methylation by age 18 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of children born between 1994 and 1995 in England and Wales and followed up from age 5 to 18 years. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2019. Exposures: High-resolution neighborhood data (indexing deprivation, dilapidation, disconnection, and dangerousness) collected across childhood. Main Outcomes and Measures: DNA methylation in whole blood was drawn at age 18 years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and methylation were tested using 3 prespecified approaches: (1) testing probes annotated to candidate genes involved in biological responses to growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and investigated in previous epigenetic research (stress reactivity-related and inflammation-related genes), (2) polyepigenetic scores indexing differential methylation in phenotypes associated with growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods (obesity, inflammation, and smoking), and (3) a theory-free epigenome-wide association study. Results: A total of 1619 participants (806 female individuals [50%]) had complete neighborhood and DNA methylation data. Children raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibited differential DNA methylation in genes involved in inflammation (beta = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P < .001) and smoking (beta = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.25; P < .001) but not obesity (beta = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .12). An epigenome-wide association study identified multiple CpG sites at an arraywide significance level of P < 1.16 x 10-7 in genes involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and methylation were small but robust to family-level socioeconomic factors and to individual-level tobacco smoking. Conclusions and Relevance: Children raised in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood epigenetically distinct from their less disadvantaged peers. This finding suggests that epigenetic regulation may be a mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment alters adult health.

Abstract: Background: Prenatal smoke exposure is known to be robustly associated with DNA methylation among offspring in early life, but whether the association persists into adulthood is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of maternal smoke exposure on DNA methylation in 754 women (mean age 30 years); to replicate findings in the same women 18 years later and in a cohort of 230 men (mean age 53 years); and to assess the extent to which a methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure. Methods: We first carried out an epigenome-wide association analysis for prenatal smoke exposure and performed replication analyses for the top CpG sites in the other samples. We derived a DNA methylation score based on previously identified CpG sites and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the performance of these scores as predictors of prenatal smoke exposure. Results: We observed associations at 15 CpG sites in 11 gene regions: MYO1G, FRMD4A, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, ARL4C, AHRR, TIFAB, MDM4, AX748264, DRD1, FTO (false discovery rate<5%). Most of these associations were specific to exposure during pregnancy, were present 18 years later and were replicated in a cohort of men. A DNA methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure (30 years previously) with an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69, 0.76). Conclusions: The results of this study provide robust evidence that maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with changes in DNA methylation that persist in the exposed offspring for many years after prenatal exposure.

Abstract: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common genomic disorder in humans and is the result of a recurrent 1.5 to 2.5 Mb deletion, encompassing approximately 20-40 genes, respectively. The clinical presentation of the typical deletion includes: Velocardiofacial, Di George, Opitz G/BBB and Conotruncalanomaly face syndromes. Atypical deletions (proximal, distal or nested) are rare and characterized mainly by normal phenotype or mild intellectual disability and variable clinical features. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this disorder are not completely understood. Because the 22q11.2 region harbours genes coding for transcriptional factors and chromatin remodelers, in this study, we performed analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of peripheral blood from 49 patients with 22q11.2DS using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip arrays. This cohort comprises 43 typical, 2 proximal and 4 distal deletions. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific episignature in all typical and proximal 22q11.2DS. The sensitivity and specificity of this signature was further confirmed by comparing it to over 1500 patients with other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. Mapping the 22q11.2DS DNA methylation episignature provides both novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and an effective tool in the molecular diagnosis of 22q11.2DS.

Abstract: Purpose: HNRNPU haploinsufficiency is associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 54. This neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and early-onset epilepsy. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis in a cohort of individuals to develop a diagnostic biomarker and gain functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of HNRNPU-related disorder. Methods: DNAm profiles of individuals carrying pathogenic HNRNPU variants, identified through an international multicenter collaboration, were assessed using Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays. Statistical and functional correlation analyses were performed comparing the HNRNPU cohort with 56 previously reported DNAm episignatures. Results: A robust and reproducible DNAm episignature and global DNAm profile were identified. Correlation analysis identified partial overlap and similarity of the global HNRNPU DNAm profile to several other rare disorders. Conclusion: This study demonstrates new evidence of a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature associated with pathogenic heterozygous HNRNPU variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for the expansion of the EpiSign diagnostic test.

Abstract: Purpose: BCL11B-related disorder (BCL11B-RD) arises from rare genetic variants within the BCL11B gene, resulting in a distinctive clinical spectrum encompassing syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder, with or without intellectual disability, associated with facial features and impaired immune function. This study presents an in-depth clinico-biological analysis of 20 newly reported individuals with BCL11B-RD, coupled with a characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of this genetic condition. Methods: Through an international collaboration, clinical and molecular data from 20 individuals were systematically gathered, and a comparative analysis was conducted between this series and existing literature. We further scrutinized peripheral blood DNA methylation profile of individuals with BCL11B-RD, contrasting them with healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders marked by established episignature. Results: Our findings unveil rarely documented clinical manifestations, notably including Rubinstein-Taybi-like facial features, craniosynostosis, and autoimmune disorders, all manifesting within the realm of BCL11B-RD. We refine the intricacies of T cell compartment alterations of BCL11B-RD, revealing decreased levels naive CD4+ T cells and recent thymic emigrants while concurrently observing an elevated proportion of effector-memory expressing CD45RA CD8+ T cells (TEMRA). Finally, a distinct DNA methylation episignature exclusive to BCL11B-RD is unveiled. Conclusion: This study serves to enrich our comprehension of the clinico-biological landscape of BCL11B-RD, potentially furnishing a more precise framework for diagnosis and follow-up of individuals carrying pathogenic BCL11B variant. Moreover, the identification of a unique DNA methylation episignature offers a valuable diagnosis tool for BCL11B-RD, thereby facilitating routine clinical practice by empowering physicians to reevaluate variants of uncertain significance within the BCL11B gene.

Abstract: There is strong evidence linking changes in DNA methylation with cigarette smoking, and smoking has long been associated with cardiovascular disease; however not many studies have investigated the effects of smoking related DNA methylation changes on cardiovascular risk, especially in young adults. We explored this relationship in 480 African American and European American men and women aged 27.3+/-3.5. Out of the DNA methylation data obtained from Illumina 450k in peripheral leukocytes, 62 CpG sites that have been associated with smoking in multiple studies were selected. Of these, 48 were significantly related to smoking within our population. These CpG sites were then used to predict 2 subclinical markers of cardiovascular health: carotid intima media thickness and left ventricular mass (LVM). There was a significant association (FDR<0.05) between LVM and 13 of these CpG sites. We constructed a DNA methylation score using these CpG sites and found a significant association between this score and LVM (p<0.01). Mediation test showed that 36.5% of the effect of smoking on LVM could be explained by this methylation score. Our data suggests that, in young adult populations, cigarette smoking related DNA methylation changes are already associated with changes in subclinical markers of cardiovascular health.

Abstract: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an overlap of myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasm, is an intractable pediatric myeloid neoplasm. Epigenetic regulation of transcription, particularly by CpG methylation, plays an important role in tumor progression, mainly by repressing tumor-suppressor genes. To clarify the clinical importance of aberrant DNA methylation, we studied the hypermethylation status of 16 target genes in the genomes of 92 patients with JMML by bisulfite conversion and the pryosequencing technique. Among 16 candidate genes, BMP4, CALCA, CDKN2A, and RARB exhibited significant hypermethylation in 72% (67/92) of patients. Based on the number of hypermethylated genes, patients were stratified into three cohorts based on an aberrant methylation score (AMS) of 0, 1-2, or 3-4. In the AMS 0 cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and transplantation-free survival (TFS) were good (69% and 76%, respectively). In the AMS 1-2 cohort, the 5-year OS was comparable to that in the AMS 0 cohort (68%), whereas TFS was poor (6%). In the AMS 3-4 cohort, 5-year OS and TFS were markedly low (8% and 0%, respectively). Epigenetic analysis provides helpful information for clinicians to select treatment strategies for patients with JMML. For patients with AMS 3-4 in whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not improve the prognosis, alternative therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and new molecular-targeting agents, should be established as treatment options.

Abstract: Blepharophimosis with intellectual disability (BIS) is a recently recognized disorder distinct from Nicolaides-Baraister syndrome that presents with distinct facial features of blepharophimosis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. BIS is caused by pathogenic variants in SMARCA2, that encodes the catalytic subunit of the superfamily II helicase group of the BRG1 and BRM-associated factors (BAF) forming the BAF complex, a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcriptional regulation. Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype-specific episignature. A distinct episignature was shared by 15 individuals with BIS-causing SMARCA2 pathogenic variants and 12 individuals with class II HVDAS caused by truncating pathogenic ADNP variants. This represents first evidence of a sensitive phenotype-specific episignature biomarker shared across distinct genetic conditions that also exhibit unique gene-specific episignatures.

Abstract: Background: Phelan-McDermid syndrome is characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. It is caused by a variable size and breakpoint microdeletions in the distal long arm of chromosome 22, referred to as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, including the SHANK3 gene. Genetic defects in a growing number of neurodevelopmental genes have been shown to cause genome-wide disruptions in epigenomic profiles referred to as epi-signatures in affected individuals. Results: In this study we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 22 individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including 11 individuals with large (2 to 5.8 Mb) 22q13.3 deletions, 10 with small deletions (< 1 Mb) or intragenic variants in SHANK3 and one mosaic case. We describe a novel genome-wide DNA methylation epi-signature in a subset of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Conclusion: We identified the critical region including the BRD1 gene as responsible for the Phelan-McDermid syndrome epi-signature. Metabolomic profiles of individuals with the DNA methylation epi-signature showed significantly different metabolomic profiles indicating evidence of two molecularly and phenotypically distinct clinical subtypes of Phelan-McDermid syndrome.

Abstract: Background: Claes-Jensen syndrome is an X-linked inherited intellectual disability caused by mutations in the KDM5C gene. Kdm5c is a histone lysine demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients. Results: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts with previously described epi-signatures. Conclusion: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C gene.

Abstract: Background: Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked syndrome (ATR-X) is caused by a mutation at the chromatin regulator gene ATRX. The mechanisms involved in the ATR-X pathology are not completely understood, but may involve epigenetic modifications. ATRX has been linked to the regulation of histone H3 and DNA methylation, while mutations in the ATRX gene may lead to the downstream epigenetic and transcriptional effects. Elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanisms altered in ATR-X will provide a better understanding about the pathobiology of this disease, as well as provide novel diagnostic biomarkers. Results: We performed genome-wide DNA methylation assessment of the peripheral blood samples from 18 patients with ATR-X and compared it to 210 controls. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific DNA methylation "epi-signature" in the peripheral blood of ATRX patients, which was corroborated by targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. Although genomically represented, differentially methylated regions showed evidence of preferential clustering in pericentromeric and telometric chromosomal regions, areas where ATRX has multiple functions related to maintenance of heterochromatin and genomic integrity. Conclusion: Most significant methylation changes in the 14 genomic loci provide a unique epigenetic signature for this syndrome that may be used as a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker to support the diagnosis of ATR-X, particularly in patients with phenotypic complexity and in patients with ATRX gene sequence variants of unknown significance.

Abstract: AIMS: Paediatric brain tumours are rare, and establishing a precise diagnosis can be challenging. Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort. METHODS: All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist. RESULTS: Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Abstract: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness due to loss of function mutations in the dystrophin gene. Variation in clinical presentation, the rate of disease progression, and treatment responsiveness have been observed amongst DMD patients, suggesting that factors beyond the loss of dystrophin may contribute to DMD pathophysiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called “episignatures”) that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. By modeling the DMD episignature, we developed a new DMD episignature biomarker and provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, which have the potential to advance more effective, personalized approaches to DMD care.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is interest in evaluating the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) which emphasizes the role of prenatal and early-life environments on non-communicable health outcomes throughout the life course. The ability to rigorously assess and identify early-life risk factors for later health outcomes, including those with childhood onset, in large population samples is often limited due to measurement challenges such as impractical costs associated with prospective studies with a long follow-up duration, short half-lives for some environmental toxicants, and lack of biomarkers that capture inter-individual differences in biologic response to external environments. RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenomic patterns, and DNA methylation in particular, have emerged as a potential objective biomarker to address some of these study design and exposure measurement challenges. In this article, we summarize the literature to date on epigenetic changes associated with specific prenatal and early-life exposure domains as well as exposure mixtures in human observational studies and their biomarker potential. Additionally, we highlight evidence for other types of epigenetic patterns to serve as exposure biomarkers. Evidence strongly supports epigenomic biomarkers of exposure that are detectable across the lifespan and across a range of exposure domains. Current and future areas of research in this field seek to expand these lines of evidence to other environmental exposures, to determine their specificity, and to develop predictive algorithms and methylation scores that can be used to evaluate early-life risk factors for health outcomes across the life span.

Abstract: Childhood trauma has been proposed to increase vulnerability to develop psychopathology in part through an altered cortisol stress response. Research in rats has suggested that this effect is mediated by methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor 17 region (GR-17 or GR-1F in humans), with higher methylation after poor maternal care leading to an increased cortisol stress response in adulthood. In humans, the associations between childhood trauma and GR-1F methylation or the cortisol stress response are equivocal. Remarkably, evidence for the relation between GR-1F methylation and the cortisol stress response has been conflicting as well. To further explore this, we investigated the associations of peripheral GR-1F methylation (52 CpGs) with the cortisol stress response (Trier Social Stress Test) and with childhood trauma in three independent studies (total N=241) including healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and unaffected siblings of patients with one of these disorders. We did not find any significant association between GR-1F methylation and the cortisol stress response (areas under the curve) or childhood trauma, nor did we observe any group differences between patients, siblings and healthy controls. Our findings do not support GR-1F methylation as a proxy for the cortisol stress response, nor its link with childhood trauma or psychopathology. These results suggest that multifactorial models for stress-related psychopathology are needed. Alternatively, future longitudinal studies may reveal GR-1F methylation to be a useful parameter at an individual level. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Abstract: Background: Epigenetic Scores (EpiScores) for blood protein levels have been associated with disease outcomes and measures of brain health, highlighting their potential usefulness as clinical biomarkers. They are typically derived via penalised regression, whereby a linear weighted sum of DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at CpG sites are predictive of protein levels. Here, we examine 84 previously published protein EpiScores as possible biomarkers of cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of general cognitive function and brain health, and incident dementia across three independent cohorts. Results: Using 84 protein EpiScores as candidate biomarkers, associations with general cognitive function (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally) were tested in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland (GS), and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (LBC1921 and LBC1936, respectively). A meta-analysis of general cognitive functioning results in all three cohorts identified 18 EpiScore associations (absolute meta-analytic standardised estimates ranged from 0.03 to 0.14, median of 0.04, PFDR < 0.05). Several associations were also observed between EpiScores and global brain volumetric measures in the LBC1936. An EpiScore for the S100A9 protein (a known Alzheimer disease biomarker) was associated with general cognitive functioning (meta-analytic standardised beta: − 0.06, P = 1.3 × 10−9), and with time-to-dementia in GS (Hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08–1.44, P = 0.003), but not in LBC1936 (Hazard ratio 1.11, P = 0.32). Conclusions: EpiScores might make a contribution to the risk profile of poor general cognitive function and global brain health, and risk of dementia, however these scores require replication in further studies.

Abstract: Asthma exacerbation and other respiratory symptoms are associated with exposure to air pollution. Since environment affects gene methylation, it is hypothesized that asthmatic responses to pollution are mediated through methylation. Materials & methods: We study the possibility that airborne particulate matter affects gene methylation in the asthma pathway. We measured methylation array data in clinic visits of 141 subjects from the Normative Aging Study. Black carbon and sulfate measures from a central monitoring site were recorded and 30-day averages were calculated for each clinic visit. Gene-specific methylation scores were calculated for the genes in the asthma pathway, and the association between the methylation in the asthma pathway and the pollution measures was analyzed using sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis. Results: The analysis found that exposures to black carbon and sulfate were significantly associated with the methylation pattern in the asthma pathway (p-values 0.05 and 0.02, accordingly). Specific genes that contributed to this association were identified. Conclusion: These results suggest that the effect of air pollution on asthmatic and respiratory responses may be mediated through gene methylation.

Abstract: Growing evidence has linked inflammatory processes to cognitive decline and dementia. This work examines whether an epigenetic marker of C-reactive protein (CRP), a common clinical inflammatory biomarker, may mediate the relationship between educational attainment and cognition. We first evaluated whether 53 previously-reported CRP-associated DNA methylation sites (CpGs) are associated with CRP, both individually and aggregated into a methylation risk score (MRSCRP), in 3298 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, mean age=69.7 years). Forty-nine CpGs (92%) were associated with the natural logarithm of CRP in HRS after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, BMI, genetic ancestry, and white blood cell counts (p<0.05), and each standard deviation increase in MRSCRP was associated a 0.38 unit increase in lnCRP (p=4.02E-99). In cross-sectional analysis, for each standard deviation increase in MRSCRP, total memory score and total cognitive score decreased, on average, by 0.28 words and 0.43 items, respectively (p<0.001). Further, MRSCRP mediated 6.9% of the relationship between high school education and total memory score in a model adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry (p<0.05); this was attenuated to 2.4% with additional adjustment for marital status, APOE epsilon4 status, health behaviors, and comorbidities (p<0.05). Thus, CRP-associated methylation may partially mediate the relationship between education and cognition at older ages. Further research is warranted to determine whether DNA methylation at these sites may improve current prediction models for cognitive impairment in older adults. Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy may enhance fetal exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) and harm neurodevelopment. We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative of in utero exposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (n = 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (n = 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (n = 583). RESULTS: The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, p = 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, p = 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, p < 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.

Abstract: Large-scale epigenome-wide association meta-analyses have identified multiple 'signatures'' of smoking. Drawing on these findings, we describe the construction of a polyepigenetic DNA methylation score that indexes smoking behavior and that can be utilized for multiple purposes in population health research. To validate the score, we use data from two birth cohort studies: The Dunedin Longitudinal Study, followed to age-38 years, and the Environmental Risk Study, followed to age-18 years. Longitudinal data show that changes in DNA methylation accumulate with increased exposure to tobacco smoking and attenuate with quitting. Data from twins discordant for smoking behavior show that smoking influences DNA methylation independently of genetic and environmental risk factors. Physiological data show that changes in DNA methylation track smoking-related changes in lung function and gum health over time. Moreover, DNA methylation changes predict corresponding changes in gene expression in pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and cellular trafficking. Finally, we present prospective data about the link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and epigenetic modifications; these findings document the importance of controlling for smoking-related DNA methylation changes when studying biological embedding of stress in life-course research. We introduce the polyepigenetic DNA methylation score as a tool both for discovery and theory-guided research in epigenetic epidemiology.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Negative life events (NLEs) increase the risk for externalizing behaviors (EBs) and internalizing behaviors (IBs) in adolescence and adult psychopathology. DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Identifying blood-based DNA methylation patterns is a minimally invasive way to detect biomarkers in predicting age, characteristics of certain diseases and conditions, as well as responses to immunotherapies. As microarray platforms continue to evolve and increase the scope of CpGs measured, new discoveries based on the most recent platform version and how they compare to available data from the previous versions of the platform are unknown. The neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI 850) is a blood-based DNA methylation biomarker built on the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array that measures epigenetic responses to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid often administered for inflammation. Here, we compare the NDMI 850 to one we built using data from the Illumina Methylation 450K (NDMI 450). RESULTS: The NDMI 450 consisted of 22 loci, 15 of which were present on the NDMI 850. In adult whole blood samples, the linear composite scores from NDMI 450 and NDMI 850 were highly correlated and had equivalent predictive accuracy for detecting DEX exposure among adult glioma patients and non-glioma adult controls. However, the NDMI 450 scores of newborn cord blood were significantly lower than NDMI 850 in samples measured with both assays. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an algorithm that reproduces the DNA methylation glucocorticoid response score using 450K data, increasing the accessibility for researchers to assess this biomarker in archived or publicly available datasets that use the 450K version of the Illumina BeadChip array. However, the NDMI850 and NDMI450 do not give similar results in cord blood, and due to data availability limitations, results from sample types of newborn cord blood should be interpreted with care.

Abstract: Background: As an epigenetic alteration, DNA methylation plays an important role in early Wilms tumorigenesis and is possibly used as marker to improve the diagnosis and classification of tumor heterogeneity. Methods: Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified. Results: Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data. Conclusion: Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis. Copyright © 2021 Tang, Lu, Lei, Lai, Lu, Li, Tang, Zhang and He.

Abstract: Background and Purpose: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are associated with distinct phenotypes that include mental retardation. Both PWS and AS are caused by loss of function of genes located in chromosome 15q11-q13, an area subject to genomic imprinting. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), based on parent of origin specific DNA methylation at the promoter region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N gene (SNRPN), can provide accurate and rapid diagnosis for nearly all PWS patients while it is less accurate for AS patients. We report the development of a referral system for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS based on M-PCR. Methods: Pediatric geneticists, psychiatrists, or neurologists were asked to evaluate phenotypes of patients with PWS or AS and complete a questionnaire designed according to the consensus criteria to diagnose these conditions. Molecular analysis based on M-PCR was performed for patients with a score of at least two. Results: A total of 108 patients with suspected PWS and 20 patients with suspected AS were referred for diagnostic testing. PWS was diagnosed in 26 of these patients and AS in two. Among the major diagnostic criteria for PWS, excessive weight gain, developmental delay, and hyperphagia were more prevalent in older patients (≥ 1 yr) than in younger patients. Cerebral hypotonia and developmental delay were significantly more prevalent in older PWS patients than in non-PWS patients. Conclusion: M-PCR is a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of PWS and AS. The limitations of current scoring systems and the low cost of M-PCR suggest that routine molecular screening is justified for patients suspected of having PWS.

Abstract: BackgroundPathogenic variants in several genes have been linked to genetic forms of isolated or combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genetic spectrum and the frequency of pathogenic variants in these genes have not yet been fully elucidated, neither in patients with dystonia nor with other, sometimes co-occurring movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).ObjectivesTo screen >2000 patients with dystonia or PD for rare variants in known dystonia-causing genes.MethodsWe screened 1207 dystonia patients from Germany (DysTract consortium), Spain, and South Korea, and 1036 PD patients from Germany for pathogenic variants using a next-generation sequencing gene panel. The impact on DNA methylation of KMT2B variants was evaluated by analyzing the gene's characteristic episignature.ResultsWe identified 171 carriers (109 with dystonia [9.0%]; 62 with PD [6.0%]) of 131 rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.005). A total of 52 patients (48 dystonia [4.0%]; four PD [0.4%, all with GCH1 variants]) carried 33 different (likely) pathogenic variants, of which 17 were not previously reported. Pathogenic biallelic variants in PRKRA were not found. Episignature analysis of 48 KMT2B variants revealed that only two of these should be considered (likely) pathogenic.ConclusionThis study confirms pathogenic variants in GCH1, GNAL, KMT2B, SGCE, THAP1, and TOR1A as relevant causes in dystonia and expands the mutational spectrum. Of note, likely pathogenic variants only in GCH1 were also found among PD patients. For DYT-KMT2B, the recently described episignature served as a reliable readout to determine the functional effect of newly identified variants. (c) 2024 The Authors.

Abstract: Heightened sensation-seeking is related to the development of delinquency. Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N = 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency.

Abstract: Analysis of genomic DNA methylation by generating epigenetic signature profiles (episignatures) is increasingly being implemented in genetic diagnosis. Here we report our experience using episignature analysis to resolve both uncomplicated and complex cases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). We analyzed 97 NDDs divided into (1) a validation cohort of 59 patients with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants characterized by a known episignature and (2) a test cohort of 38 patients harboring variants of unknown significance or unidentified variants. The expected episignature was obtained in most cases with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (53/59 [90%]), a revealing exception being the overlapping profile of two SMARCB1 pathogenic variants with ARID1A/B:c.6200, confirmed by the overlapping clinical features. In the test cohort, five cases showed the expected episignature, including (1) novel pathogenic variants in ARID1B and BRWD3; (2) a deletion in ATRX causing MRXFH1 X-linked mental retardation; and (3) confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Cornelia de Lange (CdL) syndrome in mutation-negative CdL patients. Episignatures analysis of the in BAF complex components revealed novel functional protein interactions and common episignatures affecting homologous residues in highly conserved paralogous proteins (SMARCA2 M856V and SMARCA4 M866V). Finally, we also found sex-dependent episignatures in X-linked disorders. Implementation of episignature profiling is still in its early days, but with increasing utilization comes increasing awareness of the capacity of this methodology to help resolve the complex challenges of genetic diagnoses.

Abstract: Childhood allergic diseases, including asthma, rhinitis and eczema, are prevalent conditions that share strong genetic and environmental components. Diagnosis relies on clinical history and measurements of allergen-specific IgE. We hypothesize that a multi-omics model could accurately diagnose childhood allergic disease. We show that nasal DNA methylation has the strongest predictive power to diagnose childhood allergy, surpassing blood DNA methylation, genetic risk scores, and environmental factors. DNA methylation at only three nasal CpG sites classifies allergic disease in Dutch children aged 16 years well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. This is replicated in Puerto Rican children aged 9-20 years (AUC 0.82). DNA methylation at these CpGs additionally detects allergic multimorbidity and symptomatic IgE sensitization. Using nasal single-cell RNA-sequencing data, these three CpGs associate with influx of T cells and macrophages that contribute to allergic inflammation. Our study suggests the potential of methylation-based allergy diagnosis. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

Abstract: Childhood trauma is robustly linked to a broad range of adverse outcomes with consequences persisting far into adulthood. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time. The MRSs have the potential to be a novel clinical biomarker for the assessment of trauma-related health risks. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

Abstract: Purpose: Hao-Fountain syndrome (HAFOUS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in USP7. HAFOUS is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, behavioral abnormalities, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, hypogonadism, and mild dysmorphic features. We investigated the phenotype of 18 participants with HAFOUS and performed DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis, aiming to generate a diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, we performed comparative analysis with known episignatures to gain more insight into the molecular pathophysiology of HAFOUS. Methods: We assessed genomic DNAm profiles of 18 individuals with pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in USP7 to map and validate a specific episignature. The comparison between the USP7 cohort and 56 rare genetic disorders with earlier reported DNAm episignatures was performed with statistical and functional correlation. Results: We mapped a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for pathogenic variants in USP7 and utilized this to reclassify the VUS. Comparative epigenomic analysis showed evidence of HAFOUS similarity to a number of other rare genetic episignature disorders. Conclusion: We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature as a robust diagnostic biomarker for HAFOUS that enables VUS reclassification in USP7. We also expand the phenotypic spectrum of 9 new and 5 previously reported individuals with HAFOUS.

Abstract: Clark–Baraitser syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the TRIP12 (Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interactor 12) gene. TRIP12 encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway. The ubiquitin pathway includes activating E1, conjugating E2 and ligating E3 enzymes which regulate the breakdown and sorting of proteins. This enzymatic pathway is crucial for physiological processes. A significant proportion of TRIP12 variants are currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Episignatures have been shown to represent a powerful diagnostic tool to resolve inconclusive genetic findings for Mendelian disorders and to re-classify VUSs. Here, we show the results of DNA methylation episignature analysis in 32 individuals with pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS variants in TRIP12. We identified a specific and sensitive DNA methylation (DNAm) episignature associated with pathogenic TRIP12 variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for Clark–Baraitser syndrome. In addition, we performed analysis of differentially methylated regions as well as functional correlation of the TRIP12 genome-wide methylation profile with the profiles of 56 additional neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Objective: Military servicemen deployed to war zones are at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and successful adaptation to stress is important. Epigenetic alterations in response to trauma have been identified as mechanism of adaptation and may therefore predict deployment-related PTSD symptoms. To date, human studies of epigenetic marks for traumatic stress have been largely constrained by short-term analyses of one or two time points. Method: This study in a prospective Dutch military cohort (N = 125) examined longitudinal changes of DNA methylation profiles before, as well as one and six months after deployment-related combat exposure in relation to the development of PTSD symptoms over a period of up to five years after deployment. We investigated the predictive value of specific methylation changes for immediate and delayed-onset PTSD symptoms and recovery. This epigenetic prediction was compared to polygenic risk score predictions obtained from the currently available largest genome-wide association study of PTSD. Results: A total of fourteen genomic regions were identified in which PTSD symptom levels were associated with methylation changes over time (pre-deployment, one, and six months post-deployment). Of these regions, four were significant determinants of longitudinal development of PTSD symptoms. In addition, we observed that, together with risk level during deployment (operating inside or outside the military base) and physical childhood trauma, post-deployment decreases in methylation at a genomic region in EP300/miRNA1281 was associated with a delayed onset of PTSD compared to a resilient profile. Polygenic risk, in contrast, was related to PTSD onset within six months after deployment but was not associated with long term outcomes. Conclusion: The present study suggests predictive utility of changes in DNA methylation for the subsequent development of PTSD symptoms and showed that the currently available measure of polygenic risk is primarily related to non-delayed disease onset.

Abstract: Purpose: Pathogenic variants in genes involved in the epigenetic machinery are an emerging cause of neurodevelopment disorders (NDDs). Lysine-demethylase 2B (KDM2B) encodes an epigenetic regulator and mouse models suggest an important role during development. We set out to determine whether KDM2B variants are associated with NDD. Methods: Through international collaborations, we collected data on individuals with heterozygous KDM2B variants. We applied methylation arrays on peripheral blood DNA samples to determine a KDM2B associated epigenetic signature. Results: We recruited a total of 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in KDM2B. We present evidence, including a shared epigenetic signature, to support a pathogenic classification of 15 KDM2B variants and identify the CxxC domain as a mutational hotspot. Both loss-of-function and CxxC-domain missense variants present with a specific subepisignature. Moreover, the KDM2B episignature was identified in the context of a dual molecular diagnosis in multiple individuals. Our efforts resulted in a cohort of 21 individuals with heterozygous (likely) pathogenic variants. Individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; congenital organ anomalies mainly of the heart, eyes, and urogenital system; and subtle facial dysmorphism. Conclusion: Pathogenic heterozygous variants in KDM2B are associated with NDD and a specific epigenetic signature detectable in peripheral blood.

Abstract: Chung-Jansen syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity and dysmorphic features. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the PHIP gene that encodes for the Pleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein, which is part of an epigenetic modifier protein complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHIP haploinsufficiency may impact genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the DNAm profiles of affected individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic PHIP variants with Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays and report a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature biomarker for Chung-Jansen syndrome. In addition, we observed similarities between the methylation profile of Chung-Jansen syndrome and that of functionally related and clinically partially overlapping genetic disorders, White-Kernohan syndrome (caused by variants in DDB1 gene) and Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (caused by variants in PHF6 gene). Based on these observations we also proceeded to develop a common episignature biomarker for these disorders. These newly defined episignatures can be used as part of a multiclass episignature classifier for screening of affected individuals with rare disorders and interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance, and provide further insights into the common molecular pathophysiology of the clinically-related Chung-Jansen, Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann and White-Kernohan syndromes.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis for patients living with neurodevelopmental disorders is often met with numerous challenges, related to the ambiguity of findings and lack of specificity in genetic variants leading to pathology. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has been used to develop highly sensitive and specific 'episignatures' as biomarkers capable of differentiating and classifying complex neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study we describe distinct episignatures for KAT6A syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in the lysine acetyltransferase A gene (KAT6A), and for the two neurodevelopmental disorders associated with lysine acetyl transferase B (KAT6B). We demonstrate the ability of our models to differentiate between highly overlapping episignatures, increasing the ability to effectively identify and diagnose these conditions.

Abstract: Background: Incorporating genomic data into risk prediction has become an increasingly useful approach for rapid identification of individuals most at risk for complex disorders such as PTSD. Our goal was to develop and validate Methylation Risk Scores (MRS) using machine learning to distinguish individuals who have PTSD from those who do not. Methods: Elastic Net was used to develop three risk score models using a discovery dataset (n = 1226; 314 cases, 912 controls) comprised of 5 diverse cohorts with available blood-derived DNA methylation (DNAm) measured on the Illumina Epic BeadChip. The first risk score, exposure and methylation risk score (eMRS) used cumulative and childhood trauma exposure and DNAm variables; the second, methylation-only risk score (MoRS) was based solely on DNAm data; the third, methylation-only risk scores with adjusted exposure variables (MoRSAE) utilized DNAm data adjusted for the two exposure variables. The potential of these risk scores to predict future PTSD based on pre-deployment data was also assessed. External validation of risk scores was conducted in four independent cohorts. Results: The eMRS model showed the highest accuracy (92%), precision (91%), recall (87%), and f1-score (89%) in classifying PTSD using 3730 features. While still highly accurate, the MoRS (accuracy = 89%) using 3728 features and MoRSAE (accuracy = 84%) using 4150 features showed a decline in classification power. eMRS significantly predicted PTSD in one of the four independent cohorts, the BEAR cohort (beta = 0.6839, p-0.003), but not in the remaining three cohorts. Pre-deployment risk scores from all models (eMRS, beta = 1.92; MoRS, beta = 1.99 and MoRSAE, beta = 1.77) displayed a significant (p < 0.001) predictive power for post-deployment PTSD. Conclusion: Results, especially those from the eMRS, reinforce earlier findings that methylation and trauma are interconnected and can be leveraged to increase the correct classification of those with vs. without PTSD. Moreover, our models can potentially be a valuable tool in predicting the future risk of developing PTSD. As more data become available, including additional molecular, environmental, and psychosocial factors in these scores may enhance their accuracy in predicting the condition and, relatedly, improve their performance in independent cohorts.

Abstract: Floating-Harbor syndrome (FLHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by truncating variants in exons 33 and 34 of the SNF2-related CREBBP activator protein gene (SRCAP). Truncating variants proximal to this location in SRCAP result in a non-FLHS SRCAP-associated NDD; an overlapping but distinct NDD characterized by developmental delay with or without intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, normal stature, and behavioral and psychiatric issues. Here, we report a young woman who initially presented in childhood with significant delays in speech and mild ID. In young adulthood, she developed schizophrenia. On physical examination, she had facial features suggestive of 22q11 deletion syndrome. After non-diagnostic chromosomal microarray and trio exome sequencing (ES), a re-analysis of trio ES data identified a de novo missense variant in SRCAP that was proximal to the FLHS critical region. Subsequent DNA methylation studies showed the unique methylation signature associated with pathogenic sequence variants in non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD. This clinical report describes an individual with non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD caused by an SRCAP missense variant, and it also demonstrates the clinical utility of ES re-analysis and DNA methylation analysis for undiagnosed patients, in particular, those with variants of uncertain significance.

Abstract: Rationale: Little is known about effects of paternal tobacco smoke (PTS) on the offspring's asthma and its prenatal epigenetic programming. Objective: To investigate whether PTS exposure was associated with the offspring's asthma and correlated to epigenetic CG methylation of potential tobacco-related immune genes: LMO2, GSTM1 or/and IL-10 genes. Measurements and Main Results: In a birth cohort of 1,629 newborns, we measured exposure rates of PTS (23%) and maternal tobacco smoke (MTS, 0.2%), cord blood DNA methylation, infant respiratory tract infection, childhood DNA methylation, and childhood allergic diseases. Infants with prenatal PTS exposure had a significantly higher risk of asthma by the age of 6 than those without (p = 0.026). The PTS exposure doses at 0, <20, and >= 20 cigarettes per day were significantly associated with the trend of childhood asthma and the increase of LMO2-E148 (p = 0.006), and IL10_P325 (p = 0.008) CG methylation. The combination of higher CG methylation levels of LMO2 E148, IL10_P325, and GSTM1 _P266 corresponded to the highest risk of asthma by 43.48%, compared to other combinations (16.67-23.08%) in the 3-way multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The LM02_P794 and GSTM1 _P266 CG methylation levels at age 0 were significantly correlated to those at age of 6. Conclusions: Prenatal PTS exposure increases CG methylation contents of immune genes, such as LMO2 and IL-10, which significantly retained from newborn stage to 6 years of age and correlated to development of childhood asthma. Modulation of the LMO2 and IL-10 CG methylation and/or their gene expression may provide a regimen for early prevention of PTS-associated childhood asthma. Descriptor number: 1.10 Asthma Mediators. Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: It has been better known that maternal tobacco smoke (MTS) has an impact on the offspring's asthma via epigenetic modification. Little is known about effects of paternal tobacco smoke (PTS) on the offspring's asthma and its prenatal epigenetic programming. What This Study Adds to the Field: Prenatal tobacco smoke (PTS) can program epigenetic modifications in certain genes, such as LMO2 and IL-10, and that these modifications are correlated to childhood asthma development. The higher the PTS exposure dose the higher the CG methylation levels are found. The combination of higher CG methylation levels of LMO2 E148, IL10_P325 and GSTM1_P266 corresponded to the highest risk of asthma. Measuring the DNA methylation levels of certain genes might help to predict high-risk populations for childhood asthma and provide a potential target to prevent the development of childhood asthma.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Rare genetic variants in the PURA gene cause the PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder (PURA-NDD), characterized by neonatal abnormalities and developmental delay. Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on patients with PURA variants, we aim to establish a PURA-NDD-specific methylation profile and provide further insights on the molecular basis of the PURA-NDD. METHODS: Twenty three individuals (including 12 unpublished) carrying PURA variants were enrolled. We conducted the Illumina Infinium EPIC microarray analysis in 17 PURA-NDD individuals. In vitro experiments were performed to examine how PURA variants affect Pur-a expression. RESULTS: Additional phenotypes in 12 newly identified patients were described in this study. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis unveiled distinctive methylation profiles to PURA-NDD, and the established classifier can reclassify PURA variants of uncertain significance. Patients bearing PURA hapoloinsufficient and missense variants have comparable DNA methylation profiles, and cells expressing these PURA variants showed consistent Pur-a downregulation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism. CONCLUSION: Patients with PURA-NDD exhibit a specific episignature, which has potential to aid identification and diagnosis of PURA-NDD patients and offer implications for further functional investigations.

Abstract: AIMS: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal epilepsy syndrome in adults and frequently develops drug resistance. Studies have investigated the value of peripheral DNA methylation signature as molecular biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis. We aimed to explore methylation biomarkers for TLE diagnosis and pharmacoresistance prediction. METHODS: We initially conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in TLE patients, and then selected candidate CpGs in training cohort and validated in another independent cohort by employing machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, nomogram comprising DNA methylation and clinicopathological data was generated to predict the drug response in the entire patient cohort. Lastly, bioinformatics analysis for CpG-associated genes was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: After screening and validation, eight CpGs were identified for diagnostic biomarker with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 and six CpGs for drug-resistant prediction biomarker with an AUC of 0.79. The nomogram for drug-resistant prediction comprised methylation risk score, disease course, seizure frequency, and hippocampal sclerosis, with AUC as high as 0.96. Bioinformatics analysis indicated drug response-related CpGs corresponding genes closely related to DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to use peripheral DNA methylation signature as molecular biomarker for epilepsy diagnosis and drug-resistant prediction. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Parental smoking is implicated in the etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer. We recently reported an association between an epigenetic biomarker of early-life tobacco smoke exposure at the AHRR gene and increased frequency of somatic gene deletions among ALL cases. METHODS: Here, we further assess this association using two epigenetic biomarkers for maternal smoking during pregnancy-DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and a recently established polyepigenetic smoking score-in an expanded set of 482 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases in the California Childhood Leukemia Study with available Illumina 450K or MethylationEPIC array data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the associations between the epigenetic biomarkers and gene deletion numbers. RESULTS: We found an association between DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion number among 284 childhood B-ALL cases with MethylationEPIC array data, with a ratio of means (RM) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.69] for each 0.1 beta value reduction in DNA methylation, an effect size similar to our previous report in an independent set of 198 B-ALL cases with 450K array data [meta-analysis summary RM (sRM) = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57]. The polyepigenetic smoking score was positively associated with gene deletion frequency among all 482 B-ALL cases (sRM = 1.31 for each 4-unit increase in score; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence that prenatal tobacco-smoke exposure may influence the generation of somatic copy-number deletions in childhood B-ALL. IMPACT: Analyses of deletion breakpoint sequences are required to further understand the mutagenic effects of tobacco smoke in childhood ALL.

Abstract: Importance: Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy has been associated with various health consequences, including suboptimal neurodevelopment in offspring. However, the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking on child brain development has yet to be elucidated. Objective: To investigate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring brain development in preadolescence as well as the mediating pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis. Exposures: Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score. Results: The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring.
