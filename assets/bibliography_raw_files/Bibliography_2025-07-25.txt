AB  - The estimation of chronological age from biological fluids has been an important quest for forensic scientists worldwide, with recent approaches exploiting the variability of DNA methylation patterns with age in order to develop the next generation of forensic 'DNA intelligence' tools for this application. Drawing from the conclusions of previous work utilising massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for this analysis, this work introduces a DNA methylation-based age estimation method for blood that exhibits the best combination of prediction accuracy and sensitivity reported to date. Statistical evaluation of markers from 51 studies using microarray data from over 4000 individuals, followed by validation using in-house generated MPS data, revealed a final set of 11 markers with the greatest potential for accurate age estimation from minimal DNA material. Utilising an algorithm based on support vector machines, the proposed model achieved an average error (MAE) of 3.3 years, with this level of accuracy retained down to 5 ng of starting DNA input (~ 1 ng PCR input). The accuracy of the model was retained (MAE = 3.8 years) in a separate test set of 88 samples of Spanish origin, while predictions for donors of greater forensic interest (< 55 years of age) displayed even higher accuracy (MAE = 2.6 years). Finally, no sex-related bias was observed for this model, while there were also no signs of variation observed between control and disease-associated populations for schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, frontal temporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy in microarray data relating to the 11 markers.

AB  - The incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally but their causes are generally not understood. Here we show that cumulative ancestral stress leads to premature aging and raises NCD risk in a rat population. This longitudinal study revealed that cumulative multigenerational prenatal stress (MPS) across four generations (F0-F3) raises age- and sex-dependent adverse health outcomes in F4 offspring. MPS accelerated biological aging processes and exacerbated sex-specific incidences of respiratory and kidney diseases, inflammatory processes and tumors. Unbiased deep sequencing of frontal cortex revealed that MPS altered expression of microRNAs and their target genes involved in synaptic plasticity, stress regulation, immune function and longevity. Multi-layer top-down deep learning metabolite enrichment analysis of urine markers revealed altered metabolic homeodynamics in MPS males. Thus, peripheral metabolic signatures may provide sensitive biomarkers of stress vulnerability and disease risk. Programming by MPS appears to be a significant determinant of lifetime mental health trajectories, physical wellbeing and vulnerability to NCDs through altered epigenetic regulation.

AB  - Gestational epigenetic aging (GEA) is a novel approach for characterizing associations between prenatal exposures and postnatal risks. Psychosocial adversity in pregnancy may influence GEA, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. DNA methylation to glucocorticoid regulation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes are implicated but have not been fully examined in association with GEA. This study investigated whether a polyepigenetic glucocorticoid exposure score (PGES) and HPA axis gene (NR3C1, HSD11B2, FKBP5) methylation were associated with GEA, and whether associations were sex-specific. Participants were from a prospective cohort of racial/ethnic diverse and socially disadvantaged pregnant women and infants (n = 200). DNA methylation variables were estimated using umbilical cord blood. PGES was derived with CpGs shown to be sensitive to synthetic dexamethasone exposure. NR3C1, HSD11B2, and FKBP5 methylation was summarized via factor analysis. We found that PGES (beta = -1.12, SE = 0.47, p = 0.02) and several NR3C1 and FKBP5 factor scores were associated with decelerated GEA (all p < 0.05). A significant sex interaction was observed for FKBP5 factor score 3 (beta = -0.34, SE = 0.15, p = 0.02) suggesting decelerated GEA for males but not females. This study showed that glucocorticoid regulation-related DNA methylation was associated with a decelerated aging phenotype at birth that might indicate a neonatal risk.

AB  - The prediction of the chronological age of a deceased individual at time of death can provide important information in case of unidentified bodies. The methodological possibilities in these cases depend on the availability of tissues, whereby bones are preserved for a long time due to their mineralization under normal environmental conditions. Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) as well as the accumulation of pentosidine (Pen) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) could be useful molecular markers for age prediction. A combination of such molecular clocks into one age prediction model seems favorable to minimize inter- and intra-individual variation. We therefore developed (I) age prediction models based on the three molecular clocks, (II) examined the improvement of age prediction by combination, and (III) investigated if samples with signs of decomposition can also be examined using these three molecular clocks. Skull bone from deceased individuals was collected to obtain a training dataset (n = 86), and two independent test sets (without signs of decomposition: n = 44, with signs of decomposition: n = 48). DNAm of 6 CpG sites in ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C, RPA2, TRIM59 and ZYG11A was analyzed using massive parallel sequencing (MPS). The D-Asp and Pen contents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Age prediction models based on ridge regression were developed resulting in mean absolute errors (MAEs)/root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.5years /6.6 years (DNAm), 7.7 years /9.3 years (Pen) and 11.7 years /14.6 years (D-Asp) in the test set. Unsurprisingly, a general lower accuracy for the DNAm, D-Asp, and Pen models was observed in samples from decomposed bodies (MAE: 7.4-11.8 years, RMSE: 10.4-15.4 years). This reduced accuracy could be caused by multiple factors with different impact on each molecular clock. To acknowledge general changes due to decomposition, a pilot model for a possible age prediction based on the decomposed samples as training set improved the accuracy evaluated by leave-one-out-cross validation (MAE: 6.6-12 years, RMSE: 8.1-15.9 years). The combination of all three molecular age clocks did reveal comparable MAE and RMSE results to the pure analysis of the DNA methylation for the test set without signs of decomposition. However, an improvement by the combination of all three clocks was possible for the decomposed samples, reducing especially the deviation in case of outliers in samples with very high decomposition and low DNA content. The results demonstrate the general potential in a combined analysis of different molecular clocks in specific cases.

AB  - Childhood behavioural problems pose long-term mental health risks, yet the biological basis of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms remains unclear. In a cohort of 40,212 children, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic scores (PGS), and DNA methylation profiling (EWAS) to examine the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of internalizing, externalizing, and co-occurring problems. All outcomes showed modest SNP-based heritability (h2 = 0.02–0.19, FDR < 0.05). GWAS identified a significant locus for co-occurring problems at age five (rs73161798, p = 3.26 × 10-8), near USP12, a gene implicated in neuroplasticity and risk-taking. PGS for co-occurring symptoms was associated with higher neuroticism and lower cognitive ability. DNA methylation explained substantial variance in co-occurring problems at ages three (R2 = 0.19) and five (R2 = 0.62), but not in single-domain symptoms. EWAS revealed 101 significant sites (p < 10-7) linked to neurodevelopmental, immune, and metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that co-occurring behavioural problems have a distinct, age-sensitive biological architecture.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error through recall bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalized linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - FBRSL1, together with FBRS and AUTS2 (Activator of Transcription and Developmental Regulator; OMIM 607270), constitutes a tripartite AUTS2 gene family. AUTS2 and FBRSL1 are evolutionarily more closely related to each other than to FBRS (Fibrosin 1; OMIM 608601). Despite its paralogous relation to AUTS2, FBRSL1's precise role remains unclear, though it likely shares functions in neurogenesis and transcriptional regulation. Herein, we report the clinical presentation with therapeutic approaches and the molecular etiology of a patient harboring a de novo truncating variant (c.371dupC) in FBRSL1, leading to a premature stop codon (p.Cys125Leufs*7). Our study extends previous knowledge by highlighting potential interactions and implications of this variant, alongside maternal and paternal duplications, for the patient's phenotype. Using sequence conservation data and in silico analysis of the truncated protein, we generated a predicted domain structure. Furthermore, our in silico analysis was extended by taking into account SNP array results. The extension of in silico analysis was performed due to the possibility that the coexistence of FBRSL1 truncating variant contemporary with maternal and paternal duplication could be a modifier of proband's phenotype and/or influence the novel syndrome clinical characteristics. FBRSL1 protein may be involved in neurodevelopment due to its homology with AUTS2, together with distinctive neuronal expression profiles, and thus should be considered as a potential modulation of clinical characteristics in a novel syndrome. Finally, considering that FBRSL1 is apparently involved in neurogenesis and in transcriptional regulatory networks that orchestrate gene expression, together with the observation that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns, the specific episignature has been explored.

AB  - Massively parallel sequencing, also referred to as next-generation sequencing, has positively changed DNA analysis, allowing further advances in genetics. Its capability of dealing with low quantity/damaged samples makes it an interesting instrument for forensics. The main advantage of MPS is the possibility of analyzing simultaneously thousands of genetic markers, generating high-resolution data. Its detailed sequence information allowed the discovery of variations in core forensic short tandem repeat loci, as well as the identification of previous unknown polymorphisms. Furthermore, different types of markers can be sequenced in a single run, enabling the emergence of DIP-STRs, SNP-STR haplotypes, and microhaplotypes, which can be very useful in mixture deconvolution cases. In addition, the multiplex analysis of different single nucleotide polymorphisms can provide valuable information about identity, biogeographic ancestry, paternity, or phenotype. DNA methylation patterns, mitochondrial DNA, mRNA, and microRNA profiling can also be analyzed for different purposes, such as age inference, maternal lineage analysis, body-fluid identification, and monozygotic twin discrimination. MPS technology also empowers the study of metagenomics, which analyzes genetic material from a microbial community to obtain information about individual identification, post-mortem interval estimation, geolocation inference, and substrate analysis. This review aims to discuss the main applications of MPS in forensic genetics.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) comprise clinical conditions with high genetic heterogeneity and a notable enrichment of genes involved in regulating chromatin structure and function. The EHMT1/2 epigenetic complex plays a crucial role in repression of gene transcription in a highly tissue- and temporal-specific manner. Mutations resulting in heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) of EHMT1 are implicated in Kleefstra syndrome 1 (KS1). EHMT2 is a gene acting in epigenetic regulation; however, the involvement of mutations in this gene in the etiology of NDDs has not been established thus far. A homozygous EHMT2 LoF variant [(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G] was identified by exome sequencing in an adult female patient with a phenotype resembling KS1, presenting with intellectual disability, aggressive behavior, facial dysmorphisms, fused C2-C3 vertebrae, ventricular septal defect, supernumerary nipple, umbilical hernia, and fingers and toes abnormalities. The absence of homozygous LoF EHMT2 variants in population databases underscores the significant negative selection pressure exerted on these variants. In silico evaluation of the effect of the EHMT2(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G variant predicted the abolishment of intron 3 splice donor site. However, manual inspection revealed potential cryptic donor splice sites at this EHMT2 region. To directly access the impact of this splice site variant, RNAseq analysis was employed and disclosed the usage of two cryptic donor sites within exon 3 in the patient’s blood, which are predicted to result in either an out-of-frame or in-frame effect on the protein. Methylation analysis was conducted on DNA from blood samples using the clinically validated EpiSign assay, which revealed that the patient with the homozygous EHMT2(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G splice site variant is conclusively positive for the KS1 episignature. Taken together, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic data pointed to a LoF mechanism for the EHMT2 splice variant and support this gene as a novel candidate for an autosomal recessive Kleefstra-like syndrome. The identification of additional cases with deleterious EHMT2 variants, alongside further functional validation studies, is required to substantiate EHMT2 as a novel NDD gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) investigating the association between DNA methylation (DNAm) and child neurodevelopment have been predominantly conducted within Western populations, and yielded inconsistent results, leading to a significant gap within non-Western setting, particularly in resource-limited rural areas of Central China. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between altered epigenome-wide DNAm and neurodevelopment in preschool children from resource-limited rural areas of Central China. METHODS: This case-control study involved 64 preschoolers. We assessed children's neurodevelopment using the Gesell Developmental Diagnostic Scale. The neurodevelopmental potential was expressed as a global developmental quotient (DQ) score. We conducted an EWAS with an Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip array, using blood samples from 32 suspected developmental delay children (DQ scores < 85) and 32 controls (DQ scores >= 85). Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the suspected developmental delay and control groups were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between global DQ scores and DNAm. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The BECon tool was utilized to estimate the concordance of CpGs between blood and the human brain. RESULTS: A total of 66 DMRs (PFDR < 0.05) were identified between the two groups, but no DMPs were found. After FDR correction, 844 methylated CpG sites exhibited significant associations with the global DQ scores in children. Genes annotated by methylated CpGs were mainly enriched in the "oxytocin signaling pathway", "mTOR signaling pathway", and "thyroid hormone signaling pathway". They were also involved in the "regulation of cell development", "cell-cell junction", and "ATPase activity". Among the top 20 CpGs, nine global DQ scores related-CpGs had blood-brain DNA methylation correlations, and six CpGs among them had an absolute Spearman correlation coefficient bigger than 0.2. CONCLUSIONS: Preschoolers from a former impoverished county exhibited epigenome-wide DNAm changes strongly linked to early neurodevelopment. This study enhances our understanding of the epigenetic landscape associated with early neurodevelopment, and suggests the potential for developmenting epigenetic biomarkers that could facilitate the early identification of children at a higher risk of compromised neurodevelopment, as well as holding implication to inform novel interventions, especially in underprivileged regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of acid mucopolysaccharide by the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) of the predominant disaccharide units of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (chondroitin sulfate, CS; dermatan sulfate, DS; heparan sulfate, HS) after methanolysis is validated and applicable for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type determination. METHODS: A total of 76 urine samples were collected and analyzed, from nine MPS I patients, 13 MPS II patients, seven MPS III patients, eight MPS VI patients, and 39 normal controls. Urinary GAG was first precipitated by the Alcian blue method followed by a treatment of 3 N HCl methanol. The protonated species of the methylated disaccharide products were detected by using a multiple reaction monitoring experiment. Internal standards, [2H6] CS, [2H6] DS and [2H6] HS, were prepared in-house by deuteriomethanolysis of CS, DS and HS. RESULTS: One particular disaccharide for each GAG was selected, in which the parent ion and its daughter ion after collision were m/z 426.1 -> 236.2 for DS (m/z 432 -> 239 for dimers derived from [2H6] CS and [2H6] DS) and m/z 384.2 -> 161.9 for HS (m/z 390.4 -> 162.5 for the [2H6] HS dimer). The quantities of DS and HS were determined, which varied from one MPS type to the other. The results can be used to evaluate the severity of MPS subgroups, as well as urinary GAG amelioration at follow-up after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). CONCLUSIONS: The modified LC-MS/MS method for MPS type determination is specific, sensitive, validated, accurate, and applicable for simultaneous quantifications of urinary DS and HS. This method can help to make correct diagnosis of MPS patients and evaluate the effectiveness of ERT.

AB  - The mechanism of profound generalized iduronate sulfatase (IDS) deficiency in a developmentally delayed female with clinical Hunter syndrome was studied. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the patient, using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta, showed that the paternal allele was resistant to HpaII digestion (i.e., was methylated) while the maternal allele was digested (i.e., was hypomethylated), indicating marked imbalance of X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient. Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the DXS255 locus (M27 beta), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome, and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent work suggests that DNA methylation can be used as a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure (MPS-GC), showing associations with maternal psychopathology during pregnancy. However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. METHODS: Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at birth. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT28, OMIM #617284) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by early onset movement disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. In this study, we describe the use of a genome methylation episignature methodology to functionally validate two variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the KMT2B gene. METHODS: Genome-wide methylation status was assessed using the EPIC methylation assay in peripheral blood samples from two subjects with early onset movement disorder and missense variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2B gene (p.Leu1720Phe and p.Tyr2515Cys). After QC and normalization steps, we compared the M values for all 144 probes, previously described as an EpiSign for KMT2B-related dystonia, between the two subjects and 14 controls individuals. RESULTS: The individual harboring the p.Tyr2515Cys variant exhibited a hypermethylation profile compatible with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in KMT2B, allowing for variant reclassification, conclusive genetic counseling, and patient stratification for deep brain stimulation. In contrast, the individual harboring the p.Leu1720Phe variant had a methylation status similar to controls, practically ruling out KMT2B-related dystonia. CONCLUSION: Investigation of methylation status can be a powerful tool to determine pathogenicity when facing KMT2B variants of uncertain significance. Methylation results may optimize genetic counseling and positively impact patient care. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Diffuse IDH mutant low-grade gliomas (IDHmt LGG) (World Health Organization grade 2) typically affect young adults. The outcome is variable, with survival ranging from 5 to over 20 years. The timing and choice of initial treatments after surgery remain controversial. In particular, radiotherapy is associated with early and late cognitive toxicity. Over 90% of IDHmt LGG exhibit some degree of promoter methylation of the repair gene O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methytransferase (MGMTp) that when expressed blunts the effect of alkylating agent chemotherapy, for example, temozolomide (TMZ). However, the clinical value of MGMTp methylation predicting benefit from TMZ in IDHmt LGG is unclear. Methods: Patients treated in the EORTC-22033 phase III trial comparing TMZ versus radiotherapy served as training set to establish a cutoff based on the MGMT-STP27 methylation score. A validation cohort was established with patients treated in a single-center first-line with TMZ after surgery/surgeries. Results: The MGMT-STP27 methylation score was associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) in the training cohort treated with TMZ, but not radiotherapy. In the validation cohort, an association with next treatment-free survival (P = .045) after TMZ was observed, and a trend using RANO criteria (P = .07). A cutoff value set above the 95% confidence interval of being methylated was significantly associated with PFS in the TMZ-treated training cohort, but not in the radiotherapy arm. However, this cutoff could not be confirmed in the test cohort. Conclusions: While the MGMTp methylation score was associated with better outcomes in TMZ-treated IDHmt LGG, a cutoff could not be established to guide treatment decisions.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Methylation profile scores (MPSs) index biological aging and aging-related disease in adults and are cross-sectionally associated with social determinants of health in childhood. MPSs thus provide an opportunity to trace how aging-related biology responds to environmental changes in early life. Information regarding the stability of MPSs in early life is currently lacking. Method: We use longitudinal data from children and adolescents ages 8-18 (N = 428, M age = 12.15 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Participants contributed two waves of salivary DNA-methylation data (mean lag = 3.94 years), which were used to construct four MPSs reflecting multi-system physiological decline and mortality risk (PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel), pace of biological aging (DunedinPACE), and cognitive function (Epigenetic-g). Furthermore, we exploit variation among participants in whether they were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic during the course of study participation, in order to test how a historical period characterized by environmental disruption might affect children's aging-related MPSs. Results: All MPSs showed moderate longitudinal stability (test-retest rs = 0.42, 0.44, 0.46, 0.51 for PhenoAgeAccel, GrimAgeAccel, and Epigenetic-g, and DunedinPACE, respectively). No differences in the stability of MPSs were apparent between those whose second assessment took place after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic vs. those for whom both assessments took place prior to the pandemic. Conclusions: Aging-related DNA-methylation patterns are less stable in childhood than has been previously observed in adulthood. Further developmental research on the methylome is necessary to understand which environmental perturbations in childhood impact trajectories of biological aging and when children are most sensitive to those impacts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is a biological necessity and fundamental to health. However, the associations of sleep patterns (integrating sleep determinants) with DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAm AA) remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the associations of sleep patterns with DNAm AA. METHODS: This cross-sectional and prospective cohort study used data from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort collected from 2013 to December 31, 2018. Sleep patterns were reflected by sleep scores (range 0-4, with higher scores indicating healthier sleep patterns) characterized by bedtime, sleep duration, sleep quality, and midday napping. DNAm AA was estimated by PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), GrimAge acceleration (GrimAgeAccel), DunedinPACE, and DNAm mortality risk score (DNAm MS). Linear regression models were used to estimate beta and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations between sleep patterns and DNAm AA. Mediation models were applied to assess the mediating role of DNAm AA in the associations between sleep patterns and all-cause mortality in a prospective cohort. RESULTS: Among 3566 participants (mean age 65.5 years), 426 participants died during a mean 5.4-year follow-up. A higher sleep score was associated with lower DNAm AA in a dose-response manner. Each 1-point increase in sleep score was associated with significantly lower PhenoAgeAccel (beta = - 0.208; 95% CI - 0.369 to - 0.047), GrimAgeAccel (beta = - 0.107; 95% CI - 0.207 to - 0.007), DunedinPACE (beta = - 0.008; 95% CI - 0.012 to - 0.004), and DNAm MS (beta = - 0.019; 95% CI - 0.030 to - 0.008). Chronological age modified the associations between higher sleep scores and lower PhenoAgeAccel (p for interaction = 0.031) and DunedinPACE (p for interaction = 0.027), with stronger associations observed in older adults. Moreover, a slower DunedinPACE mediated 6.2% (95% CI 0.8% to 11.5%) of the association between a higher sleep score and a lower all-cause mortality risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, individuals with a higher sleep score had a slower DNAm AA, particularly in older adults. A slower DunedinPACE partially explained the association between higher sleep scores and lower all-cause mortality risk.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution poses a global environmental challenge with significant concerns regarding its potential impact on human health. Toxicological investigations have revealed multi-system impairments caused by MPs in various organisms. However, the specific reproductive hazards in human contexts remain elusive, and understanding the transgenerational reproductive toxicity of MPs remains limited. This study delves into the reproductive toxicity resulting from lactational exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) in female mice, extending the inquiry to assess the reproductive effects on their offspring bred by rigorous natural mating. The MPs dosage corresponds to the detected concentration in infant formula prepared using plastic bottles. By systematically evaluating the reproductive phenotypes of F0 female mice from birth to adulthood, we found that female mice exposed to PS-MPs exhibited delayed puberty, disturbed estrous cyclicity, diminished fertility, elevated testosterone, abnormal follicle development, disrupted ovarian steroidogenesis, and ovarian inflammation. Importantly, the observed inheritable reproductive toxicity manifested with gender specificity, showcasing more pronounced abnormalities in male offspring. Specifically, reproductive disorders did not manifest in female offspring; however, a significant decrease in sperm count and viability was observed in PS-MPs-exposed F1 males. Testicular transcriptomics analysis of F1 males significantly enriched pathways associated with reproductive system development and epigenetic modification, such as male germ cell proliferation, DNA methylation, and histone modification. In summary, real-life exposure to PS-MPs impaired the reproductive function of female mice and threateningly disrupted the spermatogenesis of their F1 male offspring, which raises serious concerns about inter- and trans-generational reproductive toxicities of MPs in mammals. These findings underscore the potential threats of MPs to human reproductive health, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and research in this critical area. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background Inflammation is implicated in depression and psychosis, including association of childhood inflammatory markers on the subsequent risk of developing symptoms. However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Methods Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N=up-to 6,401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Results Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10-28y (n=4,262; β=0.086; 95%CI:0.036-0.137; pFDR=0.009). CRP DNAm score at birth was associated with total number of PEs, size but this association did not survive correction for multiple testing (n=822; β=0.204; 95%CI:0.024-0.388; puncorrected=0.027; pFDR=0.252). Other immune measures were not associated with depression or PEs. Conclusions Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

AB  - Autosomal dominant CDK13-related disease is characterized by congenital heart defects, dysmorphic facial features, and intellectual developmental disorder (CHDFIDD). Heterozygous pathogenic variants, particularly missense variants in the kinase domain, have previously been described as disease causing. Using the determination of a methylation pattern and comparison with an established episignature, we reveal the first hypomorphic variant in the kinase domain of CDK13, leading to a never before described autosomal recessive form of CHDFIDD in a boy with characteristic features. This highlights the utility of episignatures in variant interpretation, as well as a potential novel diagnostic approach in unsolved cases or for disease prognosis. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Germline mutations have been identified in a small number of hereditary cancers, but the genetic predisposition for many familial cancers remains to be elucidated. Methods: This study identified a Chinese pedigree that presented different cancers (breast cancer, BRCA; adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, AEG; and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL) in each of the three generations. Whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow and cancer biopsy samples. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted on the monozygotic twin brothers, one of whom developed B-ALL. Results: According to the ACMG guidelines, bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequencing revealed 20 germline mutations, particularly mutations in the DNAH11 (c.9463G > A) and CFH (c.2314G > A) genes that were documented in the COSMIC database and validated by Sanger sequencing. Forty-one common somatic mutated genes were identified in the cancer samples, displaying the same type of single nucleotide substitution Signature 5. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA as well as hypermethylation of CpG island associated with WT1 was shown in the twin with B-ALL. Conclusions: These findings reveal genomic alterations in a pedigree with multiple cancers. Mutations found in the DNAH11, CFH genes, and other genes predispose to malignancies in this family. Dysregulated methylation of WT1, PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA in the twin with B-ALL increases cancer susceptibility. The similarity of the somatic genetic changes among the three cancers indicates a hereditary impact on the pedigree. These familial cancers with germline and somatic mutations, as well as epigenomic alterations, represent a common molecular basis for many multiple cancer pedigrees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of developmental disorders (DD) is characterized by disease-specific genome-wide methylation changes. These episignatures inform on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, the detection of these episignature requires the use of indirect methylation profiling methodologies. We hypothesized that long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants but also episignatures. METHODS: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing was performed in 40 controls and 20 patients with confirmed or suspected episignature-associated DD, representing 13 distinct diseases. Following genomic variant and methylome calling, hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures. Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) for the detection of each DD. RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing-based methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based episignatures. Our SVM-based classifier identified the episignatures in 17/19 patients with a (likely) pathogenic variant and none of the controls. The remaining patients in which no episignature was identified were also classified as controls by a commercial microarray assay. In addition, we identified all underlying pathogenic single nucleotide and structural variants and showed haplotype-aware skewed X-inactivation evaluation directs clinical interpretation. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates nanopore sequencing enables episignature detection. In addition, concurrent haplotyped genomic and epigenomic analyses leverage simultaneous detection of single nucleotide/structural variants, X-inactivation, and imprinting, consolidating a multi-step sequential process into a single diagnostic assay.

AB  - Identifying and refining clinically significant patient stratification is a critical step toward realizing the promise of precision medicine in asthma. Several peripheral blood hallmarks, including total peripheral blood eosinophil count (BEC) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, are routinely used in asthma clinical practice for endotype classification and predicting response to state-of-the-art targeted biologic drugs. However, these biomarkers appear ineffective in predicting treatment outcomes in some patients, and they differ in distribution between racially and ethnically diverse populations, potentially compromising medical care and hindering health equity due to biases in drug eligibility. Here, we propose constructing an unbiased patient stratification score based on DNA methylation (DNAm) and utilizing it to refine the efficacy of hallmark biomarkers for predicting drug response. We developed Phenotype Aware Component Analysis (PACA), a novel contrastive machine-learning method for learning combinations of DNAm sites reflecting biomedically meaningful patient stratifications. Leveraging whole-blood DNAm from Latino (discovery; n=1,016) and African American (replication; n=756) pediatric asthma case-control cohorts, we applied PACA to refine the prediction of bronchodilator response (BDR) to the short-acting beta2-agonist albuterol, the most used drug to treat acute bronchospasm worldwide. While BEC and IgE correlate with BDR in the general patient population, our PACA-derived DNAm score renders these biomarkers predictive of drug response only in patients with high DNAm scores. BEC correlates with BDR in patients with upper-quartile DNAm scores (OR 1.12; 95% CI [1.04, 1.22]; P=7.9 e-4) but not in patients with lower-quartile scores (OR 1.05; 95% CI [0.95, 1.17]; P=0.21); and IgE correlates with BDR in above-median (OR for response 1.42; 95% CI [1.24, 1.63]; P=3.9e-7) but not in below-median patients (OR 1.05; 95% CI [0.92, 1.2]; P=0.57). These results hold within the commonly recognized type 2 (T2)-high asthma endotype but not in T2-low patients, suggesting that our DNAm score primarily represents an unknown variation of T2 asthma. Among T2-high patients with high DNAm scores, elevated BEC or IgE also corresponds to baseline clinical presentation that is known to benefit more from biologic treatment, including higher exacerbation scores, higher allergen sensitization, lower BMI, more recent oral corticosteroids prescription, and lower lung function. Our findings suggest that BEC and IgE, the traditional asthma biomarkers of T2-high asthma, are poor biomarkers for millions worldwide. Revisiting existing drug eligibility criteria relying on these biomarkers in asthma medical care may enhance precision and equity in treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older chronological age is associated with decreased multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse rates and increased risk of progressive disease. Measurement of biological age may be more precise than birthdate in understanding these aging effects. In addition to normal aging, MS-related accelerated aging may contribute. Measurement of biological age in adults may be confounded by the effects of natural aging and age-related comorbidities. Examining age extremes can be informative, and demonstrating accelerated biological aging in children would support a hypothesis of MS driving premature aging. We sought to compare epigenetic age in participants with pediatric-onset MS (POMS) and age-similar controls. METHODS: We performed a multicenter case-control analysis of epigenetic age in a prospectively collected set of whole blood DNA samples and clinical data. Quantitative methylation scores were derived for approximately 850,000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. Epigenetic age was calculated based on 4 established epigenetic clock algorithms. Epigenetic age and age acceleration residual (AAR) were compared between participants with POMS and age-similar controls using multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for demographic variables. RESULTS: Epigenetic age and AAR were greater in cases (n = 125, mean age 15.7 years [SD = 2.6], 63.2% female) compared with controls (n = 145, mean age 15.3 years [SD = 3.4], 63.5% female) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, tobacco exposure, and socioeconomic status. This difference was statistically significant for 2 of the 4 epigenetic clocks used (Horvath beta = 0.31 years [CI = -0.32-0.94], p = 0.33; Hannum beta = 1.50 years [CI = 0.58-2.42], p = 0.002; GrimAge beta = 0.33 years [CI = -0.30-0.96], p = 0.29; PhenoAge beta = 1.72 years [CI = 0.09-3.35], p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: We observed greater point estimates of epigenetic age in participants with POMS compared with healthy controls in all epigenetic clocks tested. This difference was statistically significant for the Hannum and PhenoAge clocks after multivariable modeling. These results are consistent with those of studies in adult MS and suggest that accelerated aging may be present even in the youngest people living with MS.

AB  - CREB-binding protein (CBP, encoded by CREBBP) and its paralog E1A-associated protein (p300, encoded by EP300) are involved in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation. Variants that produce a null allele or disrupt the catalytic domain of either protein cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), while pathogenic missense and in-frame indel variants in parts of exons 30 and 31 cause phenotypes recently described as Menke-Hennekam syndrome (MKHK). To distinguish MKHK subtypes and define their characteristics, molecular and extended clinical data on 82 individuals (54 unpublished) with variants affecting CBP (n = 71) or p300 (n = 11) (NP_004371.2 residues 1,705-1,875 and NP_001420.2 residues 1,668-1,833, respectively) were summarized. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were assessed in DNA extracted from whole peripheral blood from 54 individuals. Most variants clustered closely around the zinc-binding residues of two zinc-finger domains (ZZ and TAZ2) and within the first alpha helix of the fourth intrinsically disordered linker (ID4) of CBP/p300. Domain-specific methylation profiles were discerned for the ZZ domain in CBP/p300 (found in nine out of 10 tested individuals) and TAZ2 domain in CBP (in 14 out of 20), while a domain-specific diagnostic episignature was refined for the ID4 domain in CBP/p300 (in 21 out of 21). Phenotypes including intellectual disability of varying degree and distinct physical features were defined for each of the regions. These findings demonstrate existence of at least three MKHK subtypes, which are domain specific (MKHK-ZZ, MKHK-TAZ2, and MKHK-ID4) rather than gene specific (CREBBP/EP300). DNA methylation episignatures enable stratification of molecular pathophysiologic entities within a gene or across a family of paralogous genes. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The term “recurrent constellations of embryonic malformations” (RCEM) is used to describe a number of multiple malformation associations that affect three or more body structures. The causes of these disorders are currently unknown, and no diagnostic marker has been identified. Consequently, providing a definitive diagnosis in suspected individuals is challenging. In this study, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted on DNA samples obtained from the peripheral blood of 53 individuals with RCEM characterized by clinical features recognized as VACTERL and/or oculoauriculovertebral spectrum association. We identified a common DNA methylation episignature in 40 out of the 53 individuals. Subsequently, a sensitive and specific binary classifier was developed based on the DNA methylation episignature. This classifier can facilitate the use of RCEM episignature as a diagnostic biomarker in a clinical setting. The study also investigated the functional correlation of RCEM DNA methylation relative to other genetic disorders with known episignatures, highlighting the common genomic regulatory pathways involved in the pathophysiology of RCEM.

AB  - Purpose: Valproic acid or valproate is an effective antiepileptic drug; however, embryonic exposure to valproate can result in a teratogenic disorder referred to as fetal valproate syndrome (OMIM #609442). Currently there are no diagnostic biomarkers for the condition. This study aims to define fi ne an episignature biomarker for teratogenic antenatal exposure to valproate. Methods: DNA extracted from peripheral blood of individuals with teratogenic antenatal exposure to valproate was processed using DNA methylation microarrays. Subsequently, methylation profiling fi ling and construction of support vector machine classifiers fi ers were performed in R. Results: Genomic DNA methylation analysis was applied, and a distinct DNA methylation profile fi le was identified fi ed in the majority of affected individuals. This profile fi le was used to develop a diagnostic episignature classifier. fi er. The valproate exposure episignature exhibited high sensitivity and specificity fi city relative to a large reference data set of unaffected controls and individuals with a wide spectrum of syndromic disorders with episignatures. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated an enrichment for terms associated with cell adhesion, including significant fi cant overrepresentation of the cadherin superfamily. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of a robust peripheral blood-based diagnostic epigenetic biomarker for a prenatal teratogenic disorder.

AB  - Adaptive nanopore sequencing as a diagnostic method for imprinting disorders and episignature analysis revealed an intragenic duplication of Exon 6 and 7 in UBE3A (NM_000462.5) in a patient with relatively mild Angelman-like syndrome. In an all-in-one nanopore sequencing analysis DNA hypomethylation of the SNURF:TSS-DMR, known contributing deletions on the maternal allele and point mutations in UBE3A could be ruled out as disease drivers. In contrast, breakpoints and orientation of the tandem duplication could clearly be defined. Segregation analysis in the family showed that the duplication derived de novo in the maternal grandfather. Our study shows the benefits of an all-in-one nanopore sequencing approach for the diagnostics of Angelman syndrome and other imprinting disorders.

AB  - Rare genetic variants in ARID2 are responsible for a recently described neurodevelopmental condition called ARID2-related disorder (ARID2-RD). ARID2 belongs to PBAF, a unit of the SWI/SNF complex, which is a chromatin remodeling complex. This work aims to further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of ARID2-RD, providing clinicians with additional data for better care and aid in the future diagnosis of this condition. We obtained the genotypes and phenotypes of 27 previously unreported individuals with ARID2-RD and compared this series with findings in the literature. We also assessed peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles in individuals with ARID2-RD compared to episignatures of controls, unresolved cases, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The main clinical features of ARID2-RD are developmental delay, speech disorders, intellectual disability (ID), behavior problems, short stature, and various dysmorphic and ectodermal features. Genome-wide differential methylation analysis revealed a global hypermethylated profile in ARID2-RD that could aid in reclassifying variants of uncertain significance. Our study doubles the number of reported individuals with ARID2 pathogenic variants to 53. It confirms loss-of-function as a pathomechanism and shows the absence of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. We provide evidence for a unique DNA methylation episignature for ARID2-RD and further delineate the ARID2-associated phenotype.

AB  - The environment and events that we are exposed to in utero, during birth and in early childhood influence our future physical and mental health. The underlying mechanisms that lead to these outcomes are unclear, but long-term changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, could act as a mediating factor or biomarker. DNA methylation data were assayed at 713 522 CpG sites from 9537 participants of the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, a family-based cohort with extensive genetic, medical, family history and lifestyle information. Methylome-wide association studies of eight early life environment phenotypes and two adult mental health phenotypes (major depressive disorder and brief resilience scale) were conducted using DNA methylation data collected from adult whole blood samples. Two genes involved with different developmental pathways (PRICKLE2, Prickle Planar Cell Polarity Protein 2 and ABI1, Abl-Interactor-1) were annotated to CpG sites associated with preterm birth (P < 1.27 x 10-9). A further two genes important to the development of sensory pathways (SOBP, Sine Oculis Binding Protein Homolog and RPGRIP1, Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Interacting Protein) were annotated to sites associated with low birth weight (P < 4.35 x 10-8). The examination of methylation profile scores and genes and gene-sets annotated from associated CpGs sites found no evidence of overlap between the early life environment and mental health conditions. Birth date was associated with a significant difference in estimated lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Previous studies have shown that early life environments influence the risk of developing mental health disorders later in life; however, this study found no evidence that this is mediated by stable changes to the methylome detectable in peripheral blood.

AB  - Pathogenic heterozygous variants in CHD4 cause Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with brain anomalies, heart defects, macrocephaly, hypogonadism, and additional features with variable expressivity. Most individuals have non-recurrent missense variants, complicating variant interpretation. A few were reported with truncating variants, and their role in disease is unclear. DNA methylation episignatures have emerged as highly accurate diagnostic biomarkers in a growing number of rare diseases. We aimed to study evidence for the existence of a CHD4-related DNA methylation episignature. We collected blood DNA samples and/or clinical information from 39 individuals with CHD4 variants, including missense and truncating variants. Genomic DNA methylation analysis was performed on 28 samples. We identified a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature in samples with pathogenic missense variants within the ATPase/helicase domain. The same episignature was observed in a family with variable expressivity, a de novo variant near the PHD domain, variants of uncertain significance within the ATPase/helicase domain, and a sample with compound heterozygous variants. DNA methylation data revealed higher percentages of shared probes with BAFopathies, CHD8, and the terminal ADNP variants encoding a protein known to form the ChAHP complex with CHD4. Truncating variants, as well as a sample with a recurrent pathogenic missense variant, exhibited DNA methylation profiles distinct from the ATPase/helicase domain episignature. These DNA methylation differences, together with the distinct clinical features observed in those individuals, provide preliminary evidence for clinical and molecular sub-types in the CHD4-related disorder.

AB  - Developmental Delay with Gastrointestinal, Cardiovascular, Genitourinary, and Skeletal Abnormalities syndrome (DEGCAGS, MIM #619488) is caused by biallelic, loss-of-function (LoF) ZNF699 variants, and is characterized by variable neurodevelopmental disability, discordant organ anomalies among full siblings and infant mortality. ZNF699 encodes a KRAB zinc finger protein of unknown function. We aimed to investigate the genotype-phenotype spectrum of DEGCAGS and the possibility of a diagnostic DNA methylation episignature, to facilitate the diagnosis of a highly variable condition lacking pathognomonic clinical findings. We collected data on 30 affected individuals (12 new). GestaltMatcher analyzed fifty-three facial photographs from five individuals. In nine individuals, methylation profiling of blood-DNA was performed, and a classification model was constructed to differentiate DEGCAGS from controls. We expand the ZNF699-related molecular spectrum and show that biallelic, LoF, ZNF699 variants cause unique clinical findings with age-related presentation and a similar facial gestalt. We also identified a robust episignature for DEGCAGS syndrome. DEGCAGS syndrome is a clinically variable recessive syndrome even among siblings with a distinct methylation episignature which can be used as a screening, diagnostic and classification tool for ZNF699 variants. Analysis of differentially methylated regions suggested an effect on genes potentially implicated in the syndrome's pathogenesis. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has become a global pandemic and is one of the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular disease later in life. The correlation of epigenetic marks with obesity and related traits is being elucidated. This review summarizes the latest research and its challenges in the study of epigenetics of (childhood) obesity. SUMMARY: Epigenome-wide association studies helped identify novel targets and methylation sites that are important in the pathophysiology of obesity. In the future, such sites will become essential for developing methylation risk scores (MRS) for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Although MRS are very promising for predicting the individual risk of obesity, the implementation of MRS is challenging and has not been introduced into clinical practice so far. KEY MESSAGES: Future research will undoubtedly discover numerous methylation sites that may be involved in the development of obesity and its comorbidities, especially at a young age. This will contribute to a better understanding of the complex etiology of human obesity. From a clinical perspective, the overarching aim was to generate MRS that is robust for reliable and accurate prediction of obesity and its comorbidities. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a clinical diagnosis requiring the fulfillment of ≥ 4/6 Netchine-Harbison Clinical Scoring System (NH-CSS) criteria. A score of ≥ 4/6 NH-CSS (or ≥ 3/6 with strong clinical suspicion) warrants (epi)genetic confirmation, identifiable in ∼60% patients. The approach to the investigation and diagnosis of SRS is detailed in the only international consensus guidance, published in 2016. In the intervening years, the clinical, biochemical, and (epi)genetic characteristics of SRS have rapidly expanded, largely attributable to advancing molecular genetic techniques and a greater awareness of related disorders. The most common etiologies of SRS remain loss of methylation of chromosome 11p15 (11p15LOM) and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat). Rarer causes of SRS include monogenic pathogenic variants in imprinted (CDKN1C and IGF2) and non-imprinted (PLAG1 and HMGA2) genes. Although the age-specific NH-CSS can identify more common molecular causes of SRS, its use in identifying monogenic causes is unclear. Preliminary data suggest that NH-CSS is poor at identifying many of these cases. Additionally, there has been increased recognition of conditions with phenotypes overlapping with SRS that may fulfill NH-CSS criteria but have distinct genetic etiologies and disease trajectories. This group of conditions is frequently overlooked and under-investigated, leading to no or delayed diagnosis. Like SRS, these conditions are multisystemic disorders requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored management strategies. Early identification is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce the major burden of the diagnostic odyssey for patients and families. This article aims to enable clinicians to identify key features of rarer causes of SRS and conditions with overlapping phenotypes, show a logical approach to the molecular investigation, and highlight the differences in clinical management strategies.

AB  - DNA methylation signatures ("episignatures") can be used as biomarkers of genetic aberrations, clinical phenotypes, and environmental exposures in rare diseases. Episignatures are utilized in molecular diagnostics and can clarify variants of uncertain significance. A growing number of disease genes, including epilepsy genes, exhibit robust and reproducible episignatures. However, whether SCN1A, the most prominent epilepsy gene, has one or more episignatures has not yet been determined. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation data and performed episignature analysis on 64 individuals with Dravet syndrome due to pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SCN1A and seven individuals with early infantile SCN1A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) variants in SCN1A, relative to a large reference database of controls and rare disease episignature-positive cohorts. We analyzed all samples with LOF variants together and performed separate analyses for missense, nonsense, and GOF variant cohorts. A reproducible blood-derived episignature was not evident in any of the cohorts using current analytical approaches and reference data. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Sequence-based genetic testing identifies causative variants in ~ 50% of individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. We interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 582 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs. We identify rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to uncover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 12 individuals. Using long-read sequencing, we identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and four copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic variants associated with episignatures. Finally, we refine the CHD2 episignature using an 850 K methylation array and bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate variants as 2% (12/582) for unsolved DEE cases. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Histories of early life stress (ELS) or social discrimination can reach levels of severity characterized as toxic to mental and physical health. Such toxic social stress during development has been linked to altered acute hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to social stress in adulthood. However, there are important individual differences in the size and direction of these effects. We explored developmental, genetic, epigenetic, and contextual sources of individual differences in the relationship between ELS, discrimination, and adult responses to acute social stress in a standard laboratory test. Additional measures included perceived status, social support, background activity of HPA axis, and genetic variants in aspects of the stress response system. Participants (n = 90) answered questions about historical and ongoing stress, provided a DNA sample to examine genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic marks, and underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) during which three saliva samples were collected to assess HPA function. Individuals who reported high levels of childhood adversity had a blunted salivary cortisol response to the TSST. Childhood adversity, discrimination experiences, and MPS genotype were found to predict pretest cortisol levels. Following up on recent observations that the glucocorticoid receptor directly interacts with the mitochondria] genome, particularly the NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) gene, individuals who reported high childhood adversity were also found to have higher percent methylation across six CpG sites upstream of MT-ND6. These findings suggest multiple contributions across psychological, genetic, epigenetic, and social domains to vulnerability and resilience in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. Further study to examine how these multiple contributors affect developmental endpoints through integrated or independent pathways will be of use.

AB  - In cases of sexual assault, the evidence often exists as a mixture of female and male body fluids, and in many cases, contains a higher proportion of female body fluids than males. In these cases, Y-STR, rather than autosomal STRs, can provide useful information. It becomes very difficult to identify the true suspect if there is no match among known suspects or if a match exists for two or more suspects, e.g. two suspects from the same paternal lineage. However, age prediction using the DNA methylation of Y-chromosomal CpGs can help narrow the search for unknown suspects and discriminate between older and younger suspects. Therefore, the DNA methylation profiles of semen samples from 56 healthy Korean males were generated using Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array. Among the ten identified age-associated CpG markers located in the Y-chromosome, nine were used to construct age prediction models. The identified markers were further investigated in the MPS analysis of 147 semen samples, and the multiplex assay was validated with the reliability, reproducibility and sensitivity tests. Several age prediction models were constructed using the MPS data with the multiple linear regression, stepwise linear regression, ridge linear regression, lasso regression, elastic net linear regression and support vector machine analyses, and all showed MAEs of 5 to 7 years in the test set samples. Six single-source female samples were also subjected to MPS analysis but showed very low coverage that could not affect the analysis of the mixed samples. Therefore, the age prediction models of the present study are expected to provide useful investigative leads, especially in mixed male and female samples from sexual assault cases.

AB  - Background: Past experiences of maltreatment and life adversity induce DNA methylation changes in adults, but less is known about their impact on mothers’ maladaptive neglectful parenting and its negative effects. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate the role of DNA methylation levels in mothers with neglectful care, who were exposed to childhood maltreatment and neglect, and their current negative effects. Saliva DNA methylation was determined with the Illumina Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip v1. The individual epigenome was the input to a machine learning algorithm for trajectory inference, which assigned a specific state to each mother in the progression from healthy controls to the extreme neglect condition. A compound epigenetic maternal neglect score (EMN) was derived from 138 mothers (n = 51 in the neglectful group; n = 87 in the control non-neglectful group) having young children. Differential methylation between groups was utilized to derive the EMNs adjusted for education level, age, experimental variables, and blood cell types in saliva samples. Results: Structural equation modeling: X2 (29) = 37.81; p = 0.127; RMSEA = 0.048, confirmed that EMNs link their early experience of physical neglect to current reports of psychopathological symptoms, lower cognitive status, and observed poor mother–child emotional availability. A third of the genes annotated to the CpGs that affect EMNs are related to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative and psychopathological disorders. Conclusions: EMNs are a novel index to assess the contribution of DNA methylations as a neglected girl to later neglectful caregiving behavior and other negative effects. The evidence provided expands the possibilities for earlier interventions on the neglect condition to prevent and ameliorate the direct or indirect epigenetic impact of maternal adversities on mother–child care, helping to break the cycle of maltreatment.

AB  - Gene mutations occur with high frequency in children with mental retardation. Standard diagnostic methods, such as TMS, Sanger's sequencing of individual genes, MLPA analysis of deletions, and investigation of methylation status in Martin-Bell syndrome are not informative in the majority of cases that hampered further diagnostic efforts. Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) allowed physicians to continue diagnostic search in previously undiagnosed cases and to find molecular causes of disease. MPS permits to discover a large number of new genes and understand the pathogenesis of mental retardation and brain development more deeply. It became possible to perform prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostics. However, big data generate big problems with their interpretation the genetic counselor faces with. This review reflects the advantages and disadvantages of MPS. Different variants of MPS, including gene panels, whole exome and whole genome sequencing as well as sequencing of trios, are described. In addition, the authors discuss the difficulties of interpretation of the results and recommendations for obtaining the most accurate results.

AB  - Poly-epigenetic scores (PEGS) are surrogate measures that help capture individual-level risk. Understanding how the associations between PEGS and cardiometabolic risk factors vary by demographics and health behaviors is crucial for lowering the burden of cardiometabolic diseases. We used results from established epigenome-wide association studies to construct trait-specific PEGS from whole blood DNA methylation for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and fasting glucose. Overall and race-stratified associations between PEGS and corresponding traits were examined in adults >50 years from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 3,996, mean age = 79.5 years). We investigated how demographics (age, sex, educational attainment) and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity) modified these associations. All PEGS were positively associated with their corresponding cardiometabolic traits (p < 0.05), and most associations persisted across all racial/ethnic groups. Associations for BMI, HDL-C, and TG were stronger in younger participants, and BMI and HDL-C associations were stronger in females. The CRP association was stronger among those with a high school degree. Finally, the HDL-C association was stronger among current smokers. These findings support PEGS as robust surrogate measures and suggest the associations may differ among subgroups.

AB  - SETD2 has an essential role in epigenetic regulation. SETD2 pathogenic variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders (SETD2-NDDs) that most commonly include various degrees of intellectual disability and behavioral disorders, macrocephaly, brain malformations, and generalized overgrowth. A distinctive DNA methylation episignature has been identified for Luscan-Lumish syndrome. A less common phenotype, denoted SETD2-NDD with multiple congenital anomalies, failure to thrive, and profound intellectual disability, has been reported in association with a particular pathogenic variant (p.Arg1740Trp). To date, about 50 patients have been described in the literature with SETD2 causative variants. We report here an individual with a phenotype distinct from SETD2-NDDs, including normal cognition, distinctive facial features, and multiple tumor histories, including a sacral osteoblastoma at age 7, a benign femoral bone tumor at age 17, a peritoneal pseudomyxoma at age 27, and a hypophyseal macroadenoma and a low-grade optochiasmatic glioma at age 37 years. Trio exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous missense variant of unknown significance (p.Ser1658Leu) in the SETD2 gene. DNA methylation study by EpiSign assay confirmed the presence of an episignature profile compatible with SETD2-related disorders. Given the implication of somatic SETD2 variants in benign and malignant tumors, the implication of these SETD2 constitutional variants in tumorigenesis is discussed. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) enlargement has been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia; yet, what biological factors shape LVV during early development remain unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for neurodevelopment that is altered in schizophrenia, is a key molecular system of interest. METHODS: In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm in cord blood with LVV in childhood (measured using T1-weighted brain scans at 10 years), based on data from a large population-based birth cohort, the Generation R Study (N = 840). Employing both probe-level and methylation profile score (MPS) approaches, we further examined whether epigenetic modifications identified at birth in cord blood are: (a) also observed cross-sectionally in childhood using peripheral blood DNAm at age of 10 years (Generation R, N = 370) and (b) prospectively associated with LVV measured in young adulthood in an all-male sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 114). RESULTS: At birth, DNAm levels at four CpGs (annotated to potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, KCTD3; SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator, SDCCAG8; glutaredoxin, GLRX) prospectively associated with childhood LVV after genome-wide correction; these genes have been implicated in brain development and psychiatric traits including schizophrenia. An MPS capturing a broader epigenetic profile of LVV - but not individual top hits - showed significant cross-sectional associations with LVV in childhood in Generation R and prospectively associated with LVV in early adulthood within ALSPAC. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds suggestive evidence that DNAm at birth prospectively associates with LVV at different life stages, albeit with small effect sizes. The prediction of MPS on LVV in a childhood sample and an independent male adult sample further underscores the stability and reproducibility of DNAm as a potential marker for LVV. Future studies with larger samples and comparable time points across development are needed to further elucidate how DNAm associates with this clinically relevant brain structure and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, and what factors explain the identified DNAm profile of LVV at birth.

AB  - Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) occurs predominantly in children and is typically characterized by diffuse leptomeningeal lesions throughout the neuroaxis with focal segments of parenchymal involvement. Recent reports have identified cases without diffuse leptomeningeal involvement that retain classic glioneuronal features on histology. In this report, we present a case of a 4-year-old boy with a large cystic-solid intramedullary spinal cord lesion that on surgical biopsy revealed a biphasic astrocytic tumor with sparsely distributed eosinophilic granular bodies and Rosenthal fibers. Next-generation sequencing revealed a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, 1p/19q codeletion, and lack of an IDH1 mutation. Methylation profiling demonstrated a calibrated class score of 0.98 for DLGNT and copy number loss of 1p. Despite the morphologic similarities to pilocytic astrocytoma and the lack of oligodendroglial/neuronal components or leptomeningeal dissemination, the molecular profile was definitive in classifying the tumor as DLGNT. This case highlights the importance of molecular and genetic testing in the characterization of pediatric central nervous system tumors.

AB  - Background: Few studies have examined associations between maternal epigenetic age acceleration and adverse birth outcomes, and none have investigated paternal epigenetic age acceleration. Our objective was to assess the associations of parental (both maternal and paternal) epigenetic age acceleration in relation to birth outcomes. Methods: Parental epigenetic age was estimated using seven established epigenetic clocks in 2198 mothers and 2193 fathers from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Individual epigenetic age acceleration was then calculated as residuals from linear regressions of estimates from the epigenetic clocks on chronological age. Further, linear regression was used to analyze differences in continuous outcomes (gestational length and standardized birthweight), while logistic regression was used for binary outcomes (preterm birth, post-term birth, small-for-gestational age [SGA], large-for-gestational age [LGA], and pre-eclampsia), adjusting for chronological age, parity, educational level, smoking, and BMI. Results: Increasing maternal, but not paternal, epigenetic age acceleration was associated with decreased gestational length for five out of six clocks, with adjusted estimates ranging from a mean 0.51-day decrease (95% CI − 1.00, − 0.02; p-value 0.043) for the Horvath clock to a 0.80-day decrease (95% CI − 1.29, − 0.31; p-value 0.002) for the Levine clock. An association with increasing maternal epigenetic age acceleration according to the DunedinPACE clock was also seen with greater standardized birthweight [mean difference 0.08 (95% CI 0.04, 0.12; p-value < 0.001]. These results were also reflected in an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth and LGA. No associations were observed with post-term birth, SGA, or pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Maternal, but not paternal, epigenetic age acceleration is associated with shorter pregnancies and an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. This may suggest that women’s biological age acceleration, including factors such as metabolic and physiologic state, is an additional risk factor for preterm delivery, beyond chronological age.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether prepregnancy BMI (prePregBMI) in women with obesity was associated with differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood (CB) and whether DNAm may mediate the association of prePregBMI and early childhood BMI z score (BMIz). METHODS: From the Treatment of Obese Pregnant Women (TOP) study, 232 mother-child pairs were included. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on prePregBMI and CB DNAm (450k array), followed by causal mediation analyses to test whether DNAm may mediate effects of prePregBMI on BMIz at age 36 months (BMIz36). RESULTS: DNAm at 5345 CpG sites annotated to 2842 genes, which were overrepresented in biological processes linked to carbohydrate metabolism and plasma lipoprotein particle clearance, was associated with prePregBMI (false discovery rate < 10%). Causal mediation analyses of 168 methylation sites associated with BMIz36 (p < 0.05) and overlapping with the 5345 prePregBMI-associated sites identified two sites on SYT7 and DEAF1, partially mediating the effect of prePregBMI on BMIz36 (p <= 0.01). After cross-validation, a methylation risk score including these two sites could predict the highest quartile of BMIz36 and fat mass (in grams) with area under the curve = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85) and area under the curve = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CB DNAm at birth may partially mediate effects of prePregBMI on early childhood BMIz36, supporting its plausible role in influencing individual future obesity risk.

AB  - Disorders of developmental delay can occur from pathogenic variants in genes responsible for epigenetic regulation. Heterozygous and biallelic pathogenic variants in TET3 have recently been described in TET3-related Beck–Fahrner syndrome (TET3-BEFAHRS), representing an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity. Typical features include intellectual disability and developmental delay. Patients can also present with facial dysmorphism, seizure disorder, ophthalmic findings, and other neurobehavioral features. As the condition has recently been described and few patients have been reported in literature, the full scope of the phenotypic spectrum and approaches to identify them are still emerging. We report an individual meeting the criteria for TET3-BEFAHRS confirmed through clinical, genetic, and DNA methylation episignature analysis, who uniquely presents with bilateral chorioretinal and unilateral right iris colobomata. This case suggests a broader ophthalmic phenotype to TET3-BEFAHRS and demonstrates the utility of episignatures for the diagnosis of Mendelian disorders of epigenetic machinery.

AB  - CONTEXT: Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HI) can be the presenting feature of Kabuki syndrome (KS), which is caused by loss-of-function variants in KMT2D or KDM6A. As these genes play a critical role in maintaining methylation status in chromatin, individuals with pathogenic variants have a disease-specific epigenomic profile-an episignature. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the pathogenicity of 3 novel partial KDM6A duplications identified in 3 individuals presenting with neonatal-onset HI without typical features of KS at the time of genetic testing. METHODS: Three different partial KDM6A duplications were identified by routine targeted next-generation sequencing for HI and initially classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as their location, and hence their impact on the gene, was not known. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was undertaken to map the breakpoints of the duplications with DNA methylation profiling performed in 2 individuals to investigate the presence of a KS-specific episignature. RESULTS: WGS confirmed the duplication in proband 1 as pathogenic as it caused a frameshift in the normal copy of the gene leading to a premature termination codon. The duplications identified in probands 2 and 3 did not alter the reading frame, and therefore their significance remained uncertain after WGS. Subsequent DNA methylation profiling identified a KS-specific episignature in proband 2 but not in proband 3. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm a role for KDM6A partial gene duplications in the etiology of KS and highlight the importance of performing in-depth molecular genetic analysis to properly assess the clinical significance of VUS' in the KDM6A gene.

AB  - Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a disorder of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in CREBBP and EP300. RTS is characterized by a distinct facial gestalt, intellectual disability, structural kidney and heart differences, feeding difficulties, and broad thumbs and great toes. Individuals with EP300 variants tend to have milder disease, but overall disease features are similar. Recently, a cohort of individuals with heterozygous variants in exons 30-31 of CREBBP and homologous regions in EP300 was described. Affected individuals presented with global developmental delay, autism, feeding difficulties, vision and hearing impairment, and microcephaly, but did not share the typical RTS facial gestalt or organ malformations, suggesting an allelic disorder. Here we present a family with mild dysmorphisms, recurrent respiratory infections, and speech delay found by exome sequencing to have a missense variant in exon 8 of EP300 in the KIX CBP coactivator domain. Follow-up methylation testing revealed an abnormal methylation pattern overlapping with both RTS and Cornelia de Lange syndromes. We propose that missense variants in EP300 may cause a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome with a milder phenotype. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mutations of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene correlate mainly with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but can occasionally be pathogenic for medulloblastoma (MBL) wingless-related integration site (WNT) subtype, the course of which has only recently been described. METHODS: We retrieved all patients with documented germline APC mutations and a diagnosis of MBL to examine their outcome, late effects of treatment, and further oncological events. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2016, we treated six patients, all with a pathogenic APC variant mutation and all with MBL, classic histotype. None had metastatic disease. All patients were in complete remission a median 65 months after treatment with craniospinal irradiation at 23.4 Gy, plus a boost on the posterior fossa/tumor bed up to 54 Gy, followed by cisplatin/carboplatin, lomustine, and vincristine for a maximum of eight courses. Five of six diagnostic revised MRI were suggestive of the WNT molecular subgroup typical aspects. Methylation profile score (in two cases) and copy number variation analysis (chromosome 6 deletion in two cases) performed on four of six retrieved samples confirmed WNT molecular subgroup. Four out of six patients had a positive family history of FAP, while gastrointestinal symptoms prompted its identification in the other two cases. Four patients developed other tumors (desmoid, MELTUMP, melanoma, pancreatoblastoma, thyroid Tir3) from 5 to 7 years after MBL. DISCUSSION: Our data confirm a good prognosis for patients with MBL associated with FAP. Patients' secondary tumors may or may not be related to their syndrome or treatment, but warrant adequate attention when planning shared guidelines for these patients.

AB  - PURPOSEWe describe findings from genomic profiling of tumors among infantile pediatric patients studied within a translational research protocol established at our pediatric tertiary care center. Comprehensive genomic profiling was initiated to aid in diagnosis, prognostication, treatment, and detection of germline disease predisposition in this patient cohort.METHODSEnhanced exome sequencing of disease and comparator tissue was coupled with RNA sequencing of the disease-involved specimen to assess for single nucleotide variation, insertion/deletions, copy number alteration, structural variation, fusions, and methylation profiling-based tumor classification scores.RESULTSAmong 317 patients who consented to the protocol, 39 (12%) had infantile cancers diagnosed at <= 1 year of age. Germline genetic alteration was frequent with 11 of 39 patients (28%) harboring a pathogenic change. Clinically relevant findings affecting diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or surveillance were identified in 37 of 39 (95%) patients.CONCLUSIONOur data support that a pediatric cohort gains significant benefit from a comprehensive profiling approach, with a high yield of clinically significant findings. Nearly half of the infants in this cancer cohort harbored tumors potentially susceptible to therapeutic targets on the basis of genomic profile, and among these, another half sought benefit from therapeutic implementation.

AB  - Background: Early adversity increases the risk for mental and physical disorders as well as premature death. Epigenetic processes, and altered epigenetic aging in particular, might mediate these effects. While the literature that examined links between early adversity and epigenetic aging is growing, results have been heterogeneous. Objective: In the current work, we explored the link between early adversity and epigenetic aging in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults. Method: A total of N = 117 young adults (32% women, age mean = 26.3 years, SD = 3.6 years) with previous youth residential care placements completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Life Events Checklist (LEC-R) and provided blood samples for the analysis of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Microarray. Epigenetic age was estimated using Hovarth's and Hannum's epigenetic clocks. Furthermore, Hovarth's and Hannum's epigenetic age residuals were calculated as a proxy of epigenetic aging by regressing epigenetic age on chronological age. The statistical analysis plan was preregistered (https://osf.io/b9ev8). Results: Childhood trauma (CTQ) was negatively associated with Hannum's epigenetic age residuals, beta = -.23, p = .004 when controlling for sex, BMI, smoking status and proportional white blood cell type estimates. This association was driven by experiences of physical neglect, beta = -.25, p = .001. Lifetime trauma exposure (LEC-R) was not a significant predictor of epigenetic age residuals. Conclusion: Childhood trauma, and physical neglect in particular, was associated with decelerated epigenetic aging in our sample. More studies focusing on formerly institutionalized at-risk populations are needed to better understand which factors affect stress-related adaptations following traumatic experiences.

AB  - Importance: Children with developmental delays are at a heightened risk of experiencing mental health challenges, and this risk is exacerbated among racially minoritized children who face disproportionate adversity. Understanding the impact of parenting interventions on biological markers associated with these risks is crucial for mitigating long-term health disparities. Objective: To examine the effect of 20 weeks of an internet-based parent-child interaction training (iPCIT) program on biomarkers associated with aging and chronic inflammation among preschoolers with developmental delay at 12-month follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: An observational secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 17, 2016, to December 15, 2020, to assess changes in salivary DNA methylation (DNAm)-derived biomarkers following iPCIT intervention. Participants were recruited from 3 Part C early intervention sites in a large southeastern US city. Eligible participants included children recruited within 3 months of their third birthday who had a Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Problems T score greater than 60 and provided saliva in at least 1 study wave. Data analysis was conducted May 2023 to April 2024. Intervention: Participants received either iPCIT (a telehealth therapeutic intervention focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship and addressing behavioral challenges in young children) or referrals as usual. Main Outcomes and Measures: DNAm at the 12-month follow-up was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC Bead Chip Assay to derive biomarkers DunedinPACE, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analyses were intent-to-treat and used path analysis. Results: A total of 71 children (mean [SD] age, 36.27 [0.61] months 51 male [71.8%] and 20 female [28.2%]) were analyzed, of whom 34 received iPCIT and 37 received referrals as usual. The iPCIT group had a slower pace of aging (beta = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.50; P = .03) and less DNAm-derived CRP (beta = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.49; P = .01) relative to the control condition at the 12-month follow-up. These associations remained significant after accounting for baseline DNAm score, child demographics, and symptom severity, and were independent of predicted buccal epithelial cell proportion for both DunedinPACE and CRP. There was no association with DNAm-derived IL-6 (beta = 0.14; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.36; P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a parenting intervention, iPCIT, the association of intervention with decreased molecular markers of inflammation and biological aging suggests their potential to modify aspects of the biological embedding of stress. Understanding the systemic biological impact of such interventions offers insights into addressing health disparities and promoting resilience among vulnerable populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), sets of differential methylation marks (referred to as DNA methylation signatures or episignatures) are syndrome-specific and useful in evaluating the pathogenicity of detected genetic variants. These signatures have generally been tested using methylation arrays, requiring additional experimental and evaluation costs. As an alternative, long-read sequencing can simultaneously and accurately evaluate genetic and epigenetic changes. In addition, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling with more complete sets of CpG using long-read sequencing (than methylation arrays) may provide alternative but more comprehensive DNA methylation signatures, which have yet to be adequately investigated. METHODS: Nine and seven cases of molecularly diagnosed Sotos syndrome and ATR-X syndrome, respectively, were sequenced using nanopore long-read sequencing, together with 22 controls. Genome-wide differential DNA methylation analysis was performed. Among these differential DNA methylation sites, a single-locus DNA methylation mark at part of the NSD1 CpG island (CpGi) was subsequently studied in an additional 22 cases with a NSD1 point mutation or a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion involving NSD1. To investigate the potential utility of a single-locus DNA methylation test at NSD1 CpGi for differential diagnosis, nine cases with NSD1-negative clinically overlapping overgrowth intellectual disability syndromes (OGIDs) were also tested. RESULTS: Long-read sequencing enabled the successful extraction of two sets of differential methylation marks unique to each of Sotos syndrome and ATR-X syndrome, referred to as long-read-based DNA methylation signatures (LR-DNAm signatures), as alternatives to reported DNA methylation signatures (obtained by methylation array). Additionally, we found that a part, but not all, of the NSD1 CpGi were hypomethylated compared with the level in controls in both cases harboring NSD1 point mutations and those with a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion. This difference in methylation is specific to Sotos syndrome and lacking in other OGIDs. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous evaluation of genetic and epigenetic alterations using long-read sequencing may improve the discovery of DNA methylation signatures, which may in turn increase the diagnostic yields. As an example of the outcomes of these analyses, we propose that a single-locus DNA methylation test at NSD1 CpGi may streamline the molecular diagnosis of Sotos syndrome, regardless of the type of NSD1 aberration.

AB  - The major spliceosome contains five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs; U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) essential for splicing. Variants in RNU4-2, encoding U4, cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called ReNU syndrome. We investigated de novo variants in 50 snRNA-encoding genes in a French cohort of 23,649 individuals with rare disorders and gathered additional cases through international collaborations. Altogether, we identified 145 previously unreported probands with (likely) pathogenic variants in RNU4-2 and 21 individuals with de novo and/or recurrent variants in RNU5B-1 and RNU5A-1, encoding U5. Pathogenic variants typically arose de novo on the maternal allele and cluster in regions critical for splicing. RNU4-2 variants mainly localize to two structures, the stem III and T-loop/quasi-pseudoknot, which position the U6 ACAGAGA box for 5' splice site recognition and associate with different phenotypic severity. RNU4-2 variants result in specific defects in alternative 5' splice site usage and methylation patterns (episignatures) that correlate with variant location and clinical severity. This study establishes RNU5B-1 as a neurodevelopmental disorder gene, suggests RNU5A-1 as a strong candidate and highlights the role of de novo variants in snRNAs. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To determine associations between methylation of NR3C1, HSD11B2, FKBP5 and ADCYAP1R1 and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: In 537 newborns, placental methylation was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Profiles of neurobehavior were derived via the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scales. Using exploratory factor analysis, the relationships between methylation factor scores and neurobehavioral profiles were examined. Results: Increased scores of the factor characterized by NR3C1 methylation were associated with membership in a reactive, poorly regulated profile (odds ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.00- 2.18), while increased scores of the factor characterized by HSD11B2 methylation reduced this risk. Conclusion: These results suggest that coordinated regulation of these genes influences neurobehavior and demonstrates the importance of examining these alterations in a harmonized fashion.

AB  - Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder linked to haploinsufficiency of CREBBP (RSTS1) and EP300 (RSTS2) genes. Characteristic features often include distinctive facial traits, broad thumbs and toes, short stature, and various degrees of intellectual disability. The clinical presentation of RSTS is notably variable, making it challenging to establish a clear genotype–phenotype correlation, except for specific variants which cause the allelic Menke–Hennekam syndrome. Trio exome analysis, data collection via networking and GeneMatcher platforms, transcript processing analysis, and DNA methylation profiling were performed. We identified two unrelated patients with de novo variants in EP300 (NM_001429.4: c.3671+5G>C; c.3671+5_3671+8delGTAA) predicted to cause in-frame exon 20 skipping, confirmed in one patient. In silico 3D protein modeling suggested that exon 20 deletion (comprising 27 amino acids) likely alters the structural conformation between the RING_CBP-p300 and HAT-KAT11 domains. Clinically, both patients displayed severe RSTS2-like clinical features, including autism spectrum disorder, speech delay, hearing loss, microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, alongside ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Additionally, one patient developed early-onset colorectal cancer. DNA methylation profiling in Subject #1 confirmed RSTS but did not align with the specific episignatures for RSTS1 or RSTS2. We propose that skipping of exon 20 in EP300 is associated with a distinct form of Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome featuring clinical characteristics not fully aligning with RSTS1 or RSTS2. Our findings increase the understanding of RSTS genetic and molecular basis and stress the need for further research to establish definitive genotype–phenotype correlations.

AB  - Background Children from families with low socioeconomic status (SES), as determined by income, experience several negative outcomes, such as higher rates of newborn mortality and behavioral issues. Moreover, associations between DNA methylation and low income or poverty status are evident beginning at birth, suggesting prenatal influences on offspring development. Recent evidence suggests neighborhood opportunities may protect against some of the health consequences of living in low income households. The goal of this study was to assess whether neighborhood opportunities moderate associations between household income (HI) and neonate developmental maturity as measured with DNA methylation. Methods Umbilical cord blood DNA methylation data was available in 198 mother-neonate pairs from the larger CANDLE cohort. Gestational age acceleration was calculated using an epigenetic clock designed for neonates. Prenatal HI and neighborhood opportunities measured with the Childhood Opportunity Index (COI) were regressed on gestational age acceleration controlling for sex, race, and cellular composition. Results Higher HI was associated with higher gestational age acceleration (B = .145, t = 4.969, p = 1.56x10-6, 95% CI [.087, .202]). Contrary to expectation, an interaction emerged showing higher neighborhood educational opportunity was associated with lower gestational age acceleration at birth for neonates with mothers living in moderate to high HI (B = -.048, t = -2.08, p = .03, 95% CI [-.092, -.002]). Female neonates showed higher gestational age acceleration at birth compared to males. However, within males, being born into neighborhoods with higher social and economic opportunity was associated with higher gestational age acceleration. Conclusion Prenatal HI and neighborhood qualities may affect gestational age acceleration at birth. Therefore, policy makers should consider neighborhood qualities as one opportunity to mitigate prenatal developmental effects of HI.

AB  - PURPOSE: The current study aims to investigate the significance of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylationrelated genes in the clinical prognosis of childhood relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALLL) patient. METHODS: Transcriptome data and corresponding clinical data on m6A methylation-related genes (including 20 genes) were obtained from the Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. RESULTS: The bone marrow (BM) samples of 134 newly diagnosed (naive) and 116 relapsed B-ALL from TARGET were enrolled in the current study. Three genes (FTO, HNRNPC, RBM15B) showed significant up-regulation in relapsed B-ALL compared with that in naive B-ALL. The three genes had a significantly worse survival (P < 0.05). The LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most predictive genes as prognostic indicators, and YTHDC1 and FTO were identified as prognostic factors for relapsed B-ALL. Finally, the results of multivariate regression analysis showed that the risk score of m6A methylation-related genes was an independent prognostic factor in relapsed B-ALL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We found that the expression levels of m6A methylation-related genes were different in naive and relapsed patients with B-ALL and correlated with survival and prognosis. This implies that m6A methylation-related genes may be promising prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets for relapsed B-ALL. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, biological aging has been quantified in DNA-methylation samples of older adults and applied as so-called "methylation profile scores" (MPSs) in separate target samples, including samples of children. This nascent research indicates that (1) biological aging can be quantified early in the life course, decades before the onset of aging-related disease, (2) is affected by common environmental predictors of childhood development, and (3) shows overlap with "developmental processes" (e.g., puberty). Because the MPSs were computed using algorithms developed in adults, these studies indicate a molecular link between childhood environments, development, and adult biological aging. Yet, if MPSs can be used to connect development and aging, previous research has only traveled one way, deriving MPSs developed in adults and applying them to samples of children. Researchers have not yet quantified epigenetic measures that reflect the pace of child development, and tested whether resulting MPSs are associated with physical and psychological aging. In this perspective I posit that combining measures of biological aging with new quantifications of child development has the power to address fundamental questions about life span: How are development and experience in childhood related to biological aging in adulthood? And what is aging? Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic position (SEP), which reflects one's position in society and access to resources, is strongly tied to neurodevelopment and is associated with epigenetic changes. AIM: This study examined whether DNA methylation signatures of prenatal SEP, measured in birth samples, are associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months of age. METHODS: Prenatal SEP DNA methylation scores were derived using 97 placenta and 127 cord blood biospecimens in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation cohort. Participants completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) at 36 months of age. Generalized regression analyses, adjusting for maternal age and race, were performed to test the association between SEP methylation score, for each birth biospecimen type, and MSEL and VABS scores. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between placenta SEP methylation score and MSEL Expressive Language outcomes (beta = -2.7, p = 0.046, 95% CI [- 5.43, -0.05]) and Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.5, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-4.82, -0.16]). In cord blood, methylation-SEP scores were significantly associated with Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.0, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-3.85, -0.12]). No significant associations were observed with VABS scores. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm associations between prenatal SEP and early childhood language development using a novel empiric DNA methylation measure of exposure. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - A prior study reported no association between prenatal smoking methylation scores and adult lung cancer risk adjusting for methylation-predicted adult smoking, without considering maternal smoking trends by birth cohort. To address this gap, we examined the association between prenatal smoking methylation scores and adult lung cancer, independent of methylation-predicted adult packyears and by birth cohort, in a study nested in CLUE II. Included were 208 incident lung cancer cases ascertained by cancer registry linkage and 208 controls matched on age, sex, and smoking. DNA methylation was measured in prediagnostic blood. We calculated two prenatal smoking scores, using 19 (Score-19) and 15 (Score-15) previously identified CpGs and a methylation-predicted adult packyears score. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for adult packyears score and batch effects. Score-15 was positively associated with lung cancer (per standard deviation, OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10-1.79, P-trend = .006), especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.55-7.60, P-trend = .002). Score-19 was associated only in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.15-3.91). Participants with both prenatal scores below the median (vs all other combinations) had lower risk (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.27-0.72), especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04-0.62). Among ever smokers, participants with higher prenatal smoking scores had higher risk, irrespective of adult packyears (low: OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.38-5.72, high: OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.03-6.95). This prospective study suggests a positive association between prenatal smoking exposure and adult lung cancer risk, especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort, independent of active smoking. Future studies with multiple birth cohorts are needed.

AB  - Background: Psychosis is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Individuals with early-onset psychosis (EOP) tend to experience a worse prognosis and shorter life expectancy. The etiology of EOP remains unclear, but epigenetic mechanisms are known to serve as the interface between environmental exposures and biological processes to better understand its etiology. Objectives: We characterized the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as genome-wide epigenetic markers, in Mexican patients with EOP. Methods: We estimated epigenetic age, performed an epigenome-wide association study, and finally developed an epigenetic risk score (MRS) to predict manifestations of psychosis. Results: We found that patients with EOP have a higher epigenetic age using Wu's clock (p = 0.015). Moreover, accelerated epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age (PedBE clock, p = 0.046), global functioning (Wu's clock, p = 0.027), and psychiatric admissions (DNAmTL, p = 0.038). In addition, we observed that a reduction in years of schooling is associated with an increase on epigenetic age (Levine's clock, beta = 5.07, p = 0.001). In our epigenome-wide association study, we identified eight CpGs associated with EOP. Noteworthy, a psychosis-methylation risk score (EOP-MRS) was associated with panic disorder (beta = 1.36, p = 0.03), as well as auditory (beta = 1.28, p = 0.04) and visual (beta = 1.22, p = 0.04) hallucinations. Conclusions: Years of education have an impact on epigenetic age. Additionally, our study suggests associations of DNA methylation with EOP. Finally, we developed an MRS that associates clinical manifestations of psychosis.

AB  - Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) is a monogenic disorder arising from pathogenic variants within KMT2D and characterized by syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. We report the retrospective identification of a causative AluY insertion within KMT2D in a genetically unsolved individual with typical KS1 features, after identification of a DNA methylation signature. This is the first documentation of Alu insertion as a molecular mechanism responsible for KS1. This study emphasizes the need for reanalyzing inconclusive sequencing data in individuals with gene-specific phenotypes and reinforces episignature as a reliable diagnostic tool when NGS approaches fail to provide conclusive results in individuals with rare diseases.

AB  - In the pediatric population, BCL6-correpresor gene (BCOR)eupregulated tumors include primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumors/undifferentiated sarcomas (PMMTI/UND), clear cell sarcomas of the kidney (CCSK), and high-grade neuroepithelial tumors (HG-NET). We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) and copy number variation (CNV) profiling in these tumors (N = 34) using an Illumina EPIC BeadChip to better define the potential use of these tools to confirm diagnosis and predict outcomes. Twenty-seven tumors from 25 patients (age range, 0-10 years), showed molecular confirmation of genetic abnormalities as follows: BCOR internal tandem duplication in 14 PMMTI/UND, 8 CCSK, and 3 HG-NET and YWHAE fusions in 2 PMMTI/UND. The remaining 7 cases lacking informative molecular data were analyzed by immunophenotyping and were included in the study as a training cohort, clearly separated from the main study group. These were 4 PMMTI, 1 HG-NET, and 1 CCSK in which poor RNA preservation precluded the confirmation of BCOR rearrangements and 1 CCSK in which no rearrangements were found. DNAm data were compared with those of brain tumor and/or sarcoma classifier. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were analyzed in the 3 groups. Twenty-two cases of the 24 molecularly confirmed PMMTI/UND and CCSK and 3 of 6 of those with only immunophenotyping were classified within the methylation class "BCOR-altered sarcoma family" with optimal calibrated scores. PMMTI/UND and CCSK showed similar methylation profiles, whereas thousands of DMRs and significantly enriched pathways were evident between soft tissue/kidney tumors and HG-NET. The CNV analysis showed an overall flat profile in 19 of the 31 evaluable tumors (8/10 CCSK; 9/18 PMMTI/UND; 2/4 HG-NET). The most frequent CNVs were 1q gain and 9p and 10q loss. Follow-up time data were available for 20 patients: >= 2 CNV significantly correlated with a worse overall survival rate. In conclusion, soft tissue and kidney BCOR sarcomas matched with BCOR-altered sarcoma methylation class, whereas those from the brain matched with the central nervous system tumor classifier HG-NET BCOR, supporting the notion that DNAm profiling is an informative diagnostic tool. CNV alterations were associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

AB  - Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, the most severe group of epilepsies, are characterized by seizures and frequent epileptiform activity associated with developmental slowing or regression. Onset typically occurs in infancy or childhood and includes many well-defined epilepsy syndromes. Patients have wide-ranging comorbidities including intellectual disability, psychiatric features, such as autism spectrum disorder and behavioural problems, movement and musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal and sleep problems, together with an increased mortality rate. Problems change with age and patients require substantial support throughout life, placing a high psychosocial burden on parents, carers and the community. In many patients, the aetiology can be identified, and a genetic cause is found in >50% of patients using next-generation sequencing technologies. More than 900 genes have been identified as monogenic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and many cell components and processes have been implicated in their pathophysiology, including ion channels and transporters, synaptic proteins, cell signalling and metabolism and epigenetic regulation. Polygenic risk score analyses have shown that common variants also contribute to phenotypic variability. Holistic management, which encompasses antiseizure therapies and care for multimorbidities, is determined both by epilepsy syndrome and aetiology. Identification of the underlying aetiology enables the development of precision medicines to improve the long-term outcome of patients with these devastating diseases. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Background: It is known that being the adult child of a parent with an alcohol use disorder (ACoA) can confer a wide variety of increased health and psychological risks, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Additionally, ACoAs are at greater risk of developing alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) than individuals from families without a history of AUDs. Methods: ACoA individuals with risky hazardous alcohol use (n = 14) and those not engaged in hazardous use (n = 14) were compared to a group of healthy controls. We examined structural brain differences and applied machine learning algorithms to predict biological brain and DNA methylation ages to investigate differences and determine any accelerated aging between these groups. Results: Hazardous and non-hazardous ACoA groups had lower predicted brain ages than the healthy control group (n = 100), which may result from neuro-developmental differences between ACoA groups and controls. Within specific brain regions, we observed decreased cortical volume within bilateral pars orbitalis and frontal poles, and the left middle temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex within the hazardous alcohol ACoA group. When looking at the epigenetic aging data, the hazardous ACoA participants had increased predicted epigenetic age difference scores compared to the control group (n = 34) and the non-hazardous ACoA participant groups. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a decreased brain age in the ACoAs compared to control, concurrent with increased epigenetic age specifically in the hazardous ACoA group, laying the foundation for future research to identify individuals with an increased susceptibility to developing hazardous alcohol use. Together, these results provide a better understanding of the associations between epigenetic factors, brain structure, and alcohol use disorders.

AB  - Both genetic and environmental factors have been found to play a significant role in psychosis relapse, either independently or through their synergistic interaction. Recently, DNA methylation (DNAm) has been proposed through the calculation of methylation profile scores (MPS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of MPS as a surrogate marker of the biological impact of early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and obstetric complications, childhood adversity and toxic habits), with the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) relapse. 91 participants from a cohort of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with less than five years of evolution were classified as non-relapse (patients who had not experienced a relapse after 3 years of enrollment) or relapse (patients who relapsed during the 3-year follow-up). As inclusion criteria, patients fulfilled Andreasen's criteria of symptomatic remission. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was profiled and fourteen MPS reflecting environmental exposure were constructed including both early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and delivery issues, childhood adversity) and toxic habits. Increased levels of MPS reflecting gestational diabetes (p = 0.009), hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (p = 0.004), pre-eclampsia (p = 0.049), early preterm birth (p = 0.030), childhood adversity abuse (p = 0.021) and all childhood adversity (p = 0.030) were significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse. Our study suggests that changes in specific methylation patterns may represent one of the biological mechanisms linking early stressful life events to an increased risk of relapse.

AB  - Renal cancer (RC) is the most lethal urological malignancy with 30% late diagnosis. Over 50% RCs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. Current RC detection relies on imaging while it lacks satisfactory sensitivity for detecting small-size tumors. A sensitive and robust diagnostic tool is needed to facilitate standardized RC early detection. Herein, we performed genome-wide methylation sequencing on both tissues and urine samples for RC DNA methylation makers discovery and developed a PCR-based RC early detector (RED) using a cohort of 93 RC and 35 non-RC urine samples. RED further achieved sensitivities of 82.2% and 80.7%, and specificities of 77.1% and 75% in a testing cohort (90 RC vs. 35 non-RC) and a validation cohort (119 RC vs. 48 non-RC), respectively. Importantly, RED exhibited 89.5% sensitivity for tumors in diameter <2 cm. It can detect 83.6% clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 75.0% of translocational renal cell carcinoma, 100% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, renal malignant masenchymomas and mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma. RED showed promising performance for RC detection with early stage and small size and have potential to be used in conjunction with imaging.

AB  - Pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGG) of the cerebellum are rare, and only a few cases have been documented in detail in the literature. A major differential diagnosis for poorly differentiated tumors in the cerebellum in children is medulloblastoma. In this study, we described the histological and molecular features of a series of five pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum. They actually showed histological and immunohistochemical features that overlapped with those of medulloblastomas and achieved high scores in NanoString-based medulloblastoma diagnostic assay. Methylation profiling demonstrated these tumors were heterogeneous epigenetically, clustering to GBM_MID, DMG_K27, and GBM_RTKIII methylation classes. MYCN amplification was present in one case, and PDGFRA amplification in another two cases. Interestingly, target sequencing showed that all tumors carried TP53 mutations. Our results highlight that pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum can mimic medulloblastomas at histological and transcriptomic levels. Our report adds to the rare number of cases in the literature of cerebellar HGGs in children. We recommend the use of both methylation array and TP53 screening in the differential diagnoses of poorly differentiated embryonal-like tumors of the cerebellum.

AB  - Background: Although cavitating ultrasonic aspirators are commonly used in neurosurgical procedures, the suitability of ultrasonic aspirator-derived tumor material for diagnostic procedures is still controversial. Here, we explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic aspirator-resected tumor tissue to classify otherwise discarded sample material by fast DNA methylation-based analysis using low pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. Methods: Ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens from pediatric patients undergoing brain tumor resection were subjected to low-pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. DNA methylation-based classification using a neural network classifier and copy number variation analysis were performed. Tumor purity was estimated from copy number profiles. Results were compared to microarray (EPIC)-based routine neuropathological histomorphological and molecular evaluation. Results: 19 samples with confirmed neuropathological diagnosis were evaluated. All samples were successfully sequenced and passed quality control for further analysis. DNA and sequencing characteristics from ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens were comparable to routinely processed tumor tissue. Classification of both methods was concordant regarding methylation class in 17/19 (89%) cases. Application of a platform-specific threshold for nanopore-based classification ensured a specificity of 100%, whereas sensitivity was 79%. Copy number variation profiles were generated for all cases and matched EPIC results in 18/19 (95%) samples, even allowing the identification of diagnostically or therapeutically relevant genomic alterations. Conclusion: Methylation-based classification of pediatric CNS tumors based on ultrasonic aspirator-reduced and otherwise discarded tissue is feasible using time- and cost-efficient nanopore sequencing.

AB  - Preterm birth is closely associated with immune dysregulation in early life and subsequent learning and psychiatric disorders, but methods for stratifying infants at risk remain elusive. Epigenetic Scores (EpiScores) are relatively stable DNA methylation (DNAm)-based proxies of circulating proteins that can capture health-related exposures such as chronic inflammation. EpiScore of C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) is associated with inflammatory burden in early life, atypical brain development following preterm birth (encephalopathy of prematurity), and adult cognitive ability. To evaluate the utility of EpiScores for predicting cognition in children born preterm, we investigated relations between 43 neonatal saliva-based EpiScores known to associate with low gestational age, and cognition assessed at 2 and 5 years of age in a cohort of 232 preterm and term-born children. DNAm CRP was negatively associated with 5-year Mullen Scales of Early Learning Composite (ELC) (β = -0.273, p = 0.002). Association magnitudes were larger for children born earlier (DNAm CRP x gestational age, βinteraction = 0.181). EpiScores of CRTAM, NCAM1 and SLITRK5 were also associated with 5-year ELC in the full cohort (absolute β range 0.219 to 0.267, Bonferroni-adjusted p-values <0.01). For preterm children, associations for DNAm CRP (β = -0.318, p = 0.021) and DNAm CRTAM (β = -0.307, p = 0.006) with 5-year ELC remained significant after adjustment for inflammatory exposures. We demonstrate associations between a range of neonatal salivary EpiScores and childhood cognition, suggesting the clinical value of EpiScores as early life markers of cognitive ability in children at risk of impairment warrants further investigation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Variable expressivity is an emerging characteristic of KMT2B-related dystonia. However, it remains poorly understood whether variants reoccurring at specific sites of lysine-specific methlytransferase-2B (KMT2B) can drive intra- and interfamilial clinical heterogeneity. Our goal was to ascertain independent families with variants affecting residue Arg2565 of KMT2B. METHODS: Whole-exome/genome sequencing, multi-site recruitment, genotype-phenotype correlations, and DNA methylation episignature analysis were performed. RESULTS: We report four individuals from two families harboring the variant c.7693C > G, p.Arg2565Gly. In an additional patient, a de-novo c.7693C > T, p.Arg2565Cys variant was identified. The observed phenotypic spectrum ranged from childhood-onset dystonia (N = 2) over unspecific intellectual disability syndromes (N = 2) to undiagnosed behavioral symptoms in adulthood (N = 1). Samples bearing p.Arg2565Gly had a KMT2B-typical episignature, although the effect on methylation was less pronounced than in carriers of loss-of-function KMT2B variants. CONCLUSIONS: We established the existence of a KMT2B missense-mutation hotspot associated with varying degrees of disease severity and expression, providing information for patient counseling and elucidation of pathomechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation levels at specific sites can be used to proxy C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, providing a potentially more stable and accurate indicator of sustained inflammation and associated health risk. However, its use has been primarily limited to adults or preterm infants, and little is known about determinants for - or offspring outcomes of - elevated levels of this epigenetic proxy in cord blood. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map prenatal predictors and long-term neurobehavioral outcomes of neonatal inflammation, as assessed with an epigenetic proxy of inflammation in cord blood, in the general pediatric population. METHODS: Our study was embedded in the prospective population-based Generation R Study (n = 2,394). We created a methylation profile score of CRP (MPS-CRP) in cord blood as a marker of neonatal inflammation and validated it against serum CRP levels in mothers during pregnancy, as well as offspring at birth and in childhood. We then examined (i) which factors (previously associated with sustained inflammation) explain variability in MPS-CRP at birth, including a wide range of prenatal lifestyle and clinical conditions, pro-inflammatory exposures, as well as child genetic liability to elevated CRP levels; and (ii) whether MPS-CRP at birth associates with child neurobehavioral outcomes, including global structural MRI and DTI measures (child mean age 10 and 14 years) as well as psychiatric symptoms over time (Child Behavioral Checklist, at mean age 1.5, 3, 6, 10 and 14 years). RESULTS: MPS-CRP at birth was validated with serum CRP in cord blood (cut-off > 1 mg/L) (AUC = 0.72). Prenatal lifestyle pro-inflammatory factors explained a small part (i.e., < 5%) of the variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. No other prenatal predictor or the polygenic score of CRP in the child explained significant variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. The MPS-CRP at birth prospectively associated with a reduction in global fractional anisotropy over time on mainly a nominal threshold (beta = -0.014, SE = 0.007, p = 0.032), as well as showing nominal associations with structural differences (amygdala [(beta = 0.016, SE = 0.006, p = 0.010], cerebellum [(beta = -0.007, SE = 0.003, p = 0.036]). However, no associations with child psychiatric symptoms were observed. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to lifestyle-related pro-inflammatory factors was the only prenatal predictor that accounted for some of the individual variability in MPS-CRP levels at birth. Further, while the MPS-CRP prospectively associated with white matter alterations over time, no associations were observed at the behavioral level. Thus, the relevance and potential utility of using epigenetic data as a marker of neonatal inflammation in the general population remain unclear. In the future, the use of epigenetic proxies for a wider range of immune markers may lend further insights into the relationship between neonatal inflammation and adverse neurodevelopment within the general pediatric population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections during pregnancy have been robustly associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes in offspring, yet the underlying molecular pathways remain largely unknown. Here, we examined whether exposure to common infections in utero associates with DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns at birth and whether this in turn relates to offspring health outcomes in the general population. METHODS: Using data from 2,367 children from the Dutch population-based Generation R Study, we first performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify differentially methylated sites and regions at birth associated with prenatal infection exposure. We also examined the influence of infection timing by using self-reported cumulative infection scores for each trimester. Second, we sought to develop an aggregate methylation profile score (MPS) based on cord blood DNAm as an epigenetic proxy of prenatal infection exposure and tested whether this MPS prospectively associates with offspring health outcomes, including psychiatric symptoms, BMI, and asthma at ages 13-16 years. Third, we investigated whether prenatal infection exposure associates with offspring epigenetic age acceleration - a marker of biological aging. Across all analysis steps, we tested whether our findings replicate in 864 participants from an independent population-based cohort (ALSPAC, UK). RESULTS: We observed no differentially methylated sites or regions in cord blood in relation to prenatal infection exposure, after multiple testing correction. 33 DNAm sites showed suggestive associations (p < 5e10 - 5; of which one was also nominally associated in ALSPAC), indicating potential links to genes associated with immune, neurodevelopmental, and cardiovascular pathways. While the MPS of prenatal infections associated with maternal reports of infections in the internal hold out sample in the Generation R Study (R2incremental = 0.049), it did not replicate in ALSPAC (R2incremental = 0.001), and it did not prospectively associate with offspring health outcomes in either cohort. Moreover, we observed no association between prenatal exposure to infections and epigenetic age acceleration across cohorts and clocks. CONCLUSION: In contrast to prior studies, which reported DNAm differences in offspring exposed to severe infections in utero, we do not find evidence for associations between self-reported clinically evident common infections during pregnancy and DNAm or epigenetic aging in cord blood within the general pediatric population. Future studies are needed to establish whether associations exist but are too subtle to be statistically meaningful with present sample sizes, whether they replicate in a cohort with a more similar infection score as our discovery cohort, whether they occur in different tissues than cord blood, and whether other biological pathways may be more relevant for mediating the effect of prenatal common infection exposure on downstream offspring health outcomes.

AB  - Forensic age estimation of stain donors through DNA methylation has been intensively studied in recent years. To date, there are many published age estimation tools which are based on technologies including pyrosequencing, minisequencing, or MPS. With the implementation of such tools into routine forensic casework in many laboratories worldwide, there is a need for thorough evaluation and performance comparison. In this study, we tested published age estimation tools that are based on either minisequencing or MPS on four body fluids (blood, saliva, buccal cells and semen). All samples were analyzed with both technologies and the age estimates were compared. Biological replicates were taken from ten (blood, saliva, buccal cells) or 12 individuals (semen) to assess the reproducibility of each tool. Our study demonstrates high accuracy in estimating chronological age for various body fluids using both technologies, except for semen. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) ranged from three to five years for blood, saliva and buccal cells, while semen exhibited a higher MAE of seven to eight years. Despite the overall good performance for blood, saliva, and buccal cells, significant discrepancies were observed for some individuals both between the two technologies or when compared to their chronological age. Conclusively, we demonstrated that forensic age estimation tools based on two different technologies are similarly accurate for blood, saliva and buccal cells, while the semen tools need some adjustments before implementation into forensic casework. Our results could be helpful in the decision-making process for laboratories seeking to newly establish an age estimation workflow.

AB  - Increasing evidence implicates prenatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common endocrine-disrupting plastic chemical, in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examined whether cord blood DNA methylation, a key epigenetic marker, mediates the association between prenatal DEHP exposure and ASD/ADHD symptoms in 847 children enrolled in the Barwon Infant Study. ASD and ADHD are complex phenotypes characterised by differences at the gene regulatory network and neuronal circuit level, where heterogeneous genetic and environmental risk factors converge. Accordingly, we employed a data-driven computational strategy that helped elucidate broader functional epigenetic signatures of ASD and ADHD elicited by DEHP exposure. This included (1) a methylation profile score for DEHP exposure (MPSDEHP), and (2) an analysis of co-methylated gene networks. Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that both MPSDEHP and a DEHP-associated network of co-methylated genes mediated the effect of DEHP exposure on increased ASD and ADHD symptoms at ages 2 and 4 years (proportion of effect mediated ranged from 0.21 to 0.80). The co-methylation network was enriched for neural cell-type markers, ASD risk genes (including FOXP1, SHANK2, and PLXNB1), and targets of endocrine receptors previously linked to DEHP (including targets of the estrogen receptor ERα and the glucocorticoid receptor GR), providing biological plausibility. We validated key results in independent blood (n=66) and postmortem brain (n=40) DNA methylation datasets. These findings provide mechanistic evidence linking DEHP to ASD and ADHD symptoms and reinforce growing concerns regarding the risks of prenatal exposure.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of melanoma risk have identified 68 independent signals at 54 loci. For most loci, specific functional variants and their respective target genes remain to be established. Capture-HiC is an assay that links fine-mapped risk variants to candidate target genes by comprehensively mapping chromatin interactions. We performed a melanoma GWAS region-focused capture-HiC assay in human primary melanocytes to identify physical interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and potential causal melanoma-susceptibility genes. Overall, chromatin-interaction data alone nominated potential causal genes for 61 of the 68 melanoma risk signals, identifying many candidates beyond those reported by previous studies. We further integrated these data with epigenomic (chromatin state, accessibility), gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTL]/transcriptome-wide association study [TWAS]), DNA methylation (methylation QTL [meQTL]/methylome-wide association study [MWAS]), and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data generated from melanoma-relevant cell types to prioritize potentially cis-regulatory variants and their respective candidate gene targets. From the set of fine-mapped variants across these loci, we identified 140 prioritized credible causal variants linked to 195 candidate genes at 42 risk signals. In addition, we developed an integrative scoring system to facilitate candidate gene prioritization, integrating melanocyte and melanoma datasets. Notably, at several GWAS risk signals, we observed long-range chromatin connections (500 kb to >1 Mb) with distant candidate target genes. We validated several such cis-regulatory interactions using CRISPR inhibition, providing evidence for known cancer driver genes MDM4 and CBL, as well as the SRY-box transcription factor SOX4, as likely melanoma risk genes.

AB  - Weiss-Kruszka Syndrome (WSKA) is caused by pathogenic variants in ZNF462 representing a rare autosomal dominant congenital anomaly syndrome. It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and craniofacial abnormalities, documented in fewer than 30 patients. ZNF462, located on chromosome 9p31.2, is a transcription factor and has an important role during embryonic development and chromatin remodelling. Here, we report three new patients with WSKA, Through whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, we identified two novel variants in three patients, two of whom are siblings. These variants (c.3078dup, p.Val1027Cysfs5 and c.4792A > T p.Lys1598*) in the ZNF462 gene are likely resulting in haploinsufficiency. Our patients help to further delineate the phenotype, genotype and potential therapeutic management strategies for WSKA. Since we report a second WSKA patient with an autoimmune disease further clinical and functional studies are needed to elucidate the association between this chromatin remodelling disorder and the development of autoimmune problems. In the future, collaborative efforts are encouraged to develop an episignature for WSKA, given the gene's function and associated patient phenotypes. This new technology has the potential to provide valuable insights into the disorder. Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in TCF4, leading to intellectual disability, specific morphological features, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in PTHS, prompting the investigation of a DNA methylation (DNAm) "episignature" specific to PTHS for diagnostic purposes and variant reclassification and functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. A cohort of 67 individuals with genetically confirmed PTHS and three individuals with intellectual disability and a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in TCF4 were studied. The DNAm episignature was developed with an Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip array analysis using peripheral blood cells. Support vector machine (SVM) modeling and clustering methods were employed to generate a DNAm classifier for PTHS. Validation was extended to an additional cohort of 11 individuals with PTHS. The episignature was assessed in relation to other neurodevelopmental disorders and its specificity was examined. A specific DNAm episignature for PTHS was established. The classifier exhibited high sensitivity for TCF4 haploinsufficiency and missense variants in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain. Notably, seven individuals with TCF4 variants exhibited negative episignatures, suggesting complexities related to mosaicism, genetic factors, and environmental influences. The episignature displayed degrees of overlap with other related disorders and biological pathways. This study defines a DNAm episignature for TCF4-related PTHS, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and VUS reclassification. The finding that some cases scored negatively underscores the potential for multiple or nested episignatures and emphasizes the need for continued investigation to enhance specificity and coverage across PTHS-related variants.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without autism or seizures (NEDAUS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, speech delay, seizures, autistic features, and/or behavior abnormalities. It is caused by CUL3 (Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase) haploinsufficiency. We collected clinical and molecular data from 26 individuals carrying pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the CUL3 gene, including 20 previously unreported cases. By comparing their DNA methylation (DNAm) classifiers with those of healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by established episignatures, we aimed to create a diagnostic biomarker (episignature) and gain more knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology. We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for patients with pathogenic variants in CUL3 and utilized it to reclassify patients carrying a VUS in the CUL3 gene. Comparative epigenomic analysis revealed similarities between NEDAUS and several other rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with previously identified episignatures, highlighting the broader implication of our findings. In addition, we performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies to explain the variety in clinical presentation between the cases. We discovered a highly accurate DNAm episignature serving as a robust diagnostic biomarker for NEDAUS. Furthermore, we broadened the phenotypic spectrum by identifying 20 new individuals and confirming five previously reported cases of NEDAUS. Crown Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mendelian disorders, arising from pathogenic variations within single genetic loci, often manifest as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), affecting a significant portion of the pediatric population worldwide. These disorders are marked by atypical brain development, intellectual disabilities, and various associated phenotypic traits. Genetic testing aids in clinical diagnoses, but inconclusive results can prolong confirmation processes. Recent focus on epigenetic dysregulation has led to the discovery of DNA methylation signatures, or episignatures, associated with NDDs, accelerating diagnostic precision. Notably, TRIP12 and USP7, genes involved in the ubiquitination pathway, exhibit specific episignatures. Understanding the roles of these genes within the ubiquitination pathway sheds light on their potential influence on episignature formation. While TRIP12 acts as an E3 ligase, USP7 functions as a deubiquitinase, presenting contrasting roles within ubiquitination. Comparison of phenotypic traits in patients with pathogenic variations in these genes reveals both distinctions and commonalities, offering insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review contextualizes the roles of TRIP12 and USP7 within the ubiquitination pathway, their influence on episignature formation, and the potential implications for NDD pathogenesis. Understanding these intricate relationships may unveil novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic strategies for NDDs. Copyright © 2024 van der Laan, ten Voorde, Mannens and Henneman.

AB  - PURPOSE: ARID1A/ARID1B haploinsufficiency leads to Coffin-Siris syndrome, duplications of ARID1A lead to a distinct clinical syndrome, whilst ARID1B duplications have not yet been linked to a phenotype. METHODS: We collected patients with duplications encompassing ARID1A and ARID1B duplications. RESULTS: 16 ARID1A and 13 ARID1B duplication cases were included with duplication sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 Mb (1-44 genes) for ARID1A and 0.9 to 10.3 Mb (2-101 genes) for ARID1B. Both groups shared features, with ARID1A patients having more severe intellectual disability, growth delay, and congenital anomalies. DNA methylation analysis showed that ARID1A patients had a specific methylation pattern in blood, which differed from controls and from patients with ARID1A or ARID1B loss-of-function variants. ARID1B patients appeared to have a distinct methylation pattern, similar to ARID1A duplication patients, but further research is needed to validate these results. Five cases with duplications including ARID1A or ARID1B initially annotated as duplications of uncertain significance were evaluated using PhenoScore and DNA methylation reanalysis, resulting in the reclassification of 2 ARID1A and 2 ARID1B duplications as pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that ARID1B duplications manifest a clinical phenotype, and ARID1A duplications have a distinct episignature that overlaps with that of ARID1B duplications, providing further evidence for a distinct and emerging BAFopathy caused by whole-gene duplication rather than haploinsufficiency.

AB  - Rare variants affecting the epigenetic regulator KDM2B cause a recently delineated neurodevelopmental disorder. Interestingly, we previously identified both a general KDM2B-associated episignature and a subsignature specific to variants in the DNA-binding CxxC domain. In light of the existence of a distinct subsignature, we set out to determine if KDM2B CxxC variants are associated with a unique phenotype and disease mechanism. We recruited individuals with heterozygous CxxC variants and assessed the variants' effect on protein expression and DNA-binding ability. We analyzed clinical data from 19 individuals, including ten previously undescribed individuals with seven novel CxxC variants. The core phenotype of the KDM2B-CxxC cohort is more extensive as compared to that of individuals with KDM2B haploinsufficiency. All individuals with CxxC variants presented with developmental delay, mainly in the speech and motor domain, in addition to variable intellectual disability and mild facial dysmorphism. Congenital heart defects were observed in up to 78% of individuals, with additional common findings including musculoskeletal, ophthalmological, and urogenital anomalies, as well as behavioral challenges and feeding difficulties. Functional assays revealed that while mutant KDM2B protein with CxxC variants can be expressed in vitro, its DNA-binding ability is significantly reduced compared to wildtype. This study shows that KDM2B CxxC variants cause a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome, possibly through a molecular mechanism different from haploinsufficiency.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is a frequent habit sustained by > 1.3 billion people in 2020 and the leading preventable factor for health risk and premature mortality worldwide. In the forensic context, predicting smoking habits from biological samples may allow broadening DNA phenotyping. In this study, we aimed to implement previously published smoking habit classification models based on blood DNA methylation at 13 CpGs. First, we developed a matching lab tool based on bisulfite conversion and multiplex PCR followed by amplification-free library preparation and targeted paired-end massively parallel sequencing (MPS). Analysis of six technical duplicates revealed high reproducibility of methylation measurements (Pearson correlation of 0.983). Artificially methylated standards uncovered marker-specific amplification bias, which we corrected via bi-exponential models. We then applied our MPS tool to 232 blood samples from Europeans of a wide age range, of which 90 were current, 71 former and 71 never smokers. On average, we obtained 189,000 reads/sample and 15,000 reads/CpG, without marker drop-out. Methylation distributions per smoking category roughly corresponded to previous microarray analysis, showcasing large inter-individual variation but with technology-driven bias. Methylation at 11 out of 13 smoking-CpGs correlated with daily cigarettes in current smokers, while solely one was weakly correlated with time since cessation in former smokers. Interestingly, eight smoking-CpGs correlated with age, and one displayed weak but significant sex-associated methylation differences. Using bias-uncorrected MPS data, smoking habits were relatively accurately predicted using both two- (current/non-current) and three- (never/former/current) category model, but bias correction resulted in worse prediction performance for both models. Finally, to account for technology-driven variation, we built new, joint models with inter-technology corrections, which resulted in improved prediction results for both models, with or without PCR bias correction (e.g. MPS cross-validation F1-score > 0.8; 2-categories). Overall, our novel assay takes us one step closer towards the forensic application of viable smoking habit prediction from blood traces. However, future research is needed towards forensically validating the assay, especially in terms of sensitivity. We also need to further shed light on the employed biomarkers, particularly on the mechanistics, tissue specificity and putative confounders of smoking epigenetic signatures.

AB  - Background: While the association between caregiver-child interaction and early childhood development (ECD) has been observed, the underlying biological mechanism remains to be elucidated. Objective: This study aimed to examine the potential role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in the association between caregiver-child interaction and ECD among preschool children living in rural China. Methods: This study was conducted in a rural area in Central China. ECD was evaluated with the Gesell Development Diagnosis Scale (Chinese version), yielding a developmental quotient (DQ), i.e. global neurodevelopmental score (NDS). Caregiver-child interaction was assessed using the Brigance Parent-Child Interaction Scale. Of the 171 children aged 3–6 years who participated in ECD assessment and blood samples collection, a total of 64 were selected for epigenome-wide association study with Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip array (850 K). The linear regression model in the R package “CpGassoc”was applied to identify CpG sites associated with global NDS and caregiver-child interaction. The causal inference test (CIT) was utilized to explore the potential mediation effect of DNA methylation. Results: Our epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 844 CpG sites significantly associated with children’s global NDS (PFDR<0.05), while no CpG sites were found to be directly related to caregiver-child interaction after FDR correction. Mediation analysis indicated that 395 CpG sites mediated the association between caregiver-child interaction and children’s ECD before FDR correction; and among the genes with top 20 CpG sites, genes CFAP45 (cg07740897), PCDH9 (cg20666533), LAMC3 (cg14447608), FAM19A5 (cg13192640), PRKG1 (cg09071556), PLEKHG5 (cg05151739), TCERG1 (cg09189322), and MTRR (cg08075506) have been reported to be associated with neurodevelopment and related diseases. Conclusions: Blood DNA methylation may mediate the association between caregiver-child interaction and ECD in preschool children. This provides population-level epigenetic evidence supporting parenting interventions for vulnerable preschool children who experience poor caregiver-child interaction, aiming to ensure optimal early development potential. However, future studies in diverse populations are needed to validate these findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Polycomb group proteins are key epigenetic transcriptional regulators. Multiple neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with pathogenic variants of the genes encoding Polycomb group proteins. RYBP is a core component of the noncanonical Polycomb Repressor Complex 1; however, its role in disease is unclear. METHODS: Functional consequences of RYBP variants were assessed using in vitro cellular and in vivo Drosophila melanogaster studies. RESULTS: We described 7 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants of RYBP and their clinical findings, including severe developmental delay, dysmorphisms, and multiple congenital anomalies. We showed that all single-nucleotide variants in RYBP localize to the N-terminal domain of the gene, which encodes the zinc-finger domain and ubiquitin-binding moiety. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the RYBP c.132C>G p.(Cys44Trp) variant causes reduced protein expression but does not affect the binding of YY1, RING1B, or ubiquitin. In vivo overexpression studies in Drosophila melanogaster showed a dramatic functional difference between human RYBP and its variant forms, affecting the C44 amino acid residue. DNA methylation studies suggested a possible episignature associated with RYBP-related disorder. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous de novo variants in RYBP are associated with an identifiable syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder with multiple congenital anomalies.

AB  - DNA methylation is known as a biomarker for age with applications in forensics. Here we describe the VISAGE (VISible Attributes through GEnomics) Consortium's enhanced tool for epigenetic age estimation in somatic tissues. The tool is based on eight DNA methylation markers (44 CpGs), bisulfite multiplex PCR followed by sequencing on the MiSeq FGx platform, and three statistical prediction models for blood, buccal cells and bones. The model for blood is based on six CpGs from ELOVL2, MIR29B2CHG, KLF14, FHL2, TRIM59 and PDE4C, and predicts age with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.2 years, while the model for buccal cells includes five CpGs from PDE4C, MIR29B2CHG, ELOVL2, KLF14 and EDARADD and predicts age with MAE of 3.7 years, and the model for bones has six CpGs from ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C and ASPA and predicts age with MAE of 3.4 years. The VISAGE enhanced tool for age estimation in somatic tissues enables reliable collection of DNA methylation data from small amounts of DNA using a sensitive multiplex MPS assay that provides accurate estimation of age in blood, buccal swabs, and bones using the statistical model tailored to each tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient enzymatic activity of N-acetyl galactosamine-4-sulphatase, which is caused by mutations in the arylsulphatase B (ARSB) gene. To date, 163 different types of mutations in the ARSB have been reported. However, the full mutation spectrum in the MPS VI phenotype is still not known. The aim of this study was to perform molecular testing of the ARSB gene in the patient and his family members to confirm MPS VI. METHODS: Molecular characterisation of the ARSB gene was performed using Sanger sequencing. We studied a child suspected of having MPS VI and 16 other relatives. RESULTS: We identified a C-to-T transition resulting in an exchange of the Arg codon 160 for a premature stop codon (R160*, in exon 2). The transition was in CpG dinucleotides. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The study provided some insights into the genotype-phenotype relationship in MPS VI and the importance of genetic testing when diagnosing MPS, which is not a mandatory test for the diagnosis and only very occasionally performed. Additionally, we present here the history of a family with confirmed MPS VI, which is extremely rare especially in south-eastern Poland. What is more, the position where the mutation is located is very interesting because it is the region of CpG, which is the site of the methylation process. Thus, this opens the possibility of a new approach indicating the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism that should be examined in the context of the pathomechanism of MPS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic algorithms of aging, health, and cognition, based on DNA-methylation (DNAm) patterns, are prominent tools for measuring biological age and have been linked to age-related diseases, cognitive decline, and mortality. While most of these methylation profile scores (MPSs) are developed in blood tissue, there is growing interest in using less invasive tissues like saliva. The aim of the current study is to probe the cross-tissue intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of MPSs developed in blood applied to saliva DNAm from the same people. While our primary focus is on MPSs that were previously found to be robustly correlated with social determinants of health, including second- and third-generation clocks and MPSs of physiology and cognition, we also report ICC values for first-generation clocks to enable comparison across metrics. We pooled three publicly available datasets that had both saliva and blood DNAm from the same individuals (total n = 107, aged 5-74 years), corrected MPSs for cell composition within each tissue, and computed the cross-tissue ICCs. RESULTS: We found that after correcting for cell composition, saliva-blood cross-tissue ICCs were moderate for second- and third-generation indices of aging and MPSs of physiology and cognition. Specifically, PCGrimAge had the highest ICC (0.76), followed by PCPhenoAge (0.72), a measure of cognitive performance (Epigenetic-g, 0.69), DunedinPACE (0.68), PCGrimAge Acceleration (0.67), PCPhenoAge Acceleration (0.66), an MPS of hs-CRP (0.58), and BMI (0.54). These ICCs appear lower than previous reports on within-tissue ICCs (saliva ICCs range from 0.67 to 0.85, blood ICCs range from 0.73 to 0.93). Cross-tissue ICCs values for first-generation biological age acceleration measures were poor, ranging from 0.19 to 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that applying second- and third-generation MPSs of biological age acceleration and related phenotypes developed in blood to saliva DNAm results in moderate cross-tissue similarity and the precise cross-tissue correspondence differs by measure. While the degree of cross-tissue similarity of several MPSs may suffice for some research settings, it may not be suitable in clinical or commercial applications. Collection of both blood and saliva DNAm samples is necessary to validate existing algorithms and to customize MPSs in saliva DNAm. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Differentiating between monozygotic (MZ) twins remains difficult because they have the same genetic makeup. Applying the traditional STR genotyping approach cannot differentiate one from the other. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of two or more different mtDNA copies within a single cell and this phenomenon is common in humans. The levels of heteroplasmy cannot change dramatically during transmission in the female germ line but increase or decrease during germ-line transmission and in somatic tissues during life. As massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology has advanced, it has shown the extraordinary quantity of mtDNA heteroplasmy in humans. In this study, a probe hybridization technique was used to obtain mtDNA and then MPS was performed with an average sequencing depth of above 4000. The results showed us that all ten pairs of MZ twins were clearly differentiated with the minor heteroplasmy threshold at 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Finally, we used a probe that targeted mtDNA to boost sequencing depth without interfering with nuclear DNA and this technique can be used in forensic genetics to differentiate the MZ twins.

AB  - Introduction: Current guidelines recommend broad sequencing as a first-tier test for epilepsy, identifying a genetic etiology in 40% of cases. Sequencing subsequently increases the number of patients identified with variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). Clinicians desire additional investigatory methods to better classify these VUSs. Case Presentation: The HNRNPU gene (MIM #602869) is associated with a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, epilepsy, and characteristic facial features. To date, only de novo variants with complete penetrance have been described. We present a 7-year-old female with HNRNPU variant c.669-691dup; p.Gly231- Valfs∗116, classified as both pathogenic (Laboratory A) and as a VUS (Laboratory B). This patient exhibits an isolated seizure phenotype, and familial studies revealed the proband's father (asymptomatic), paternal uncle (epilepsy), and paternal grandmother (asymptomatic) all carry this variant. Laboratory B theorized the potential for alternative splicing, reducing concerns about pathogenicity. Methylation studies were pursued for more accurate classification and are conclusively negative for the HNRNPU episignature. This, in the context of the variant not segregating with the familial epilepsy phenotype, indicates a benign classification for the c.669-691dup; p.Gly231Valfs∗116 variant. Conclusion: The number of epilepsy patients with nondiagnostic genetic results requires additional modes of investigation. Reclassification often takes years due to the novelty of variants identified. This case highlights the importance of laboratory scrutiny when multiple variants are detected, the need for greater data sharing between laboratories to reduce inconsistent classifications, and the utility of ancillary testing, such as methylation studies, to aid in VUS reclassification.

AB  - Plastics found in our everyday environment are becoming an increasing concern for individual and population-level health, and the extent of exposure and potential toxic effects of these contaminants on numerous human organ systems are becoming clear. Microplastics (MPs), tiny plastic particles, appear to have many of the same biological effects as their plastic precursors and have the compounded effect of potential accumulation in different organs. Recently, microplastic accumulation was observed in the human placenta, raising important questions related to the biological effects of these contaminants on the health of pregnancies and offspring. These concerns are particularly heightened considering the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) framework, which postulates that in utero exposure can programme the lifelong health of the offspring. The current review examines the state of knowledge on this topic and highlights important avenues for future investigation.
