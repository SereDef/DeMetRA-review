AB  - Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have been associated with an increased risk of delayed neurodevelopment in children as well as differential newborn DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the biological mechanisms connecting PTE and PAE, DNAm, and neurodevelopment are largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether differential DNAm mediates the association between PTE and PAE and neurodevelopment at 6 (N = 112) and 24 months (N = 184) in children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. PTE and PAE were assessed antenatally using urine cotinine measurements and the ASSIST questionnaire, respectively. Cord blood DNAm was measured using the EPIC and 450 K BeadChips. Neurodevelopment (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behavior, socioemotional) was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We constructed methylation risk scores (MRS) for PTE and PAE and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) with these MRS as mediators. Next, we conducted a high-dimensional mediation analysis to identify individual CpG sites as potential mediators, followed by a CMA to estimate the average causal mediation effects (ACME) and total effect (TE). PTE and PAE were associated with neurodevelopment at 6 but not at 24 months. PTE MRS reached a prediction accuracy (R2) of 0.23 but did not significantly mediate the association between PTE and neurodevelopment. PAE MRS was not predictive of PAE (R2 = 0.006). For PTE, 31 CpG sites and eight CpG sites were identified as significant mediators (ACME and TE P < 0.05) for the cognitive and motor domains at 6 months, respectively. For PAE, 16 CpG sites and 1 CpG site were significant mediators for the motor and adaptive behavior domains at 6 months, respectively. Several of the associated genes, including MAD1L1, CAMTA1, and ALDH1A2 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting that differential DNAm may partly explain the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTE and PAE and child neurodevelopment.

AB  - Objective: Worldwide increasing childhood obesity is due to interactions between environmental and genetic factors, linked together by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. Methods: 82 obese children (>95th BMI percentile, age: 3-18 years) were included. Anthropometric data, metabolic parameters, 25-OH vitamin D (25OHD), and pubertal status were recorded, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring was performed. BMI standard deviation score (SDS) was calculated. Using candidate gene approach, obesity-(insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), proopiomelanocortin (POMC)) and vitamin D metabolism-related genes (1-alfa-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), VDR) regulated by DNA methylation were selected. After isolating DNA from peripheral blood, bisulfite conversion, bisulfite specific polymerase chain reaction (BS-PCR), and pyrosequencing were carried out. Results: No significant correlation between 25-OHD and metabolic parameters and DNA methylation status, but a tendency of positive correlation between VDR methylation status and 25-OHD (r = 0.2053,p = 0.066) were observed. Significant positive correlations between BMI SDS and CYP27B1 hypermethylation (r = 0.2371,p = 0.0342) and a significant negative correlation between IGF2 hypomethylation and BMI SDS (r =-0.305,p = 0.0059) were found. Conclusions Rate of obesity shows correlation with DNA methylation. Hypomethylation of IGF2 and hypermethylation of CYP27B1 genes might positively influence the rate of BMI observed in obese children.

AB  - Methylation of host and viral genes is promising for triage of women with high-risk human papillomavirus infections (hrHPV). Using a population-based sample of hrHPV positive women with cervical biopsies within 12 months after cervical screening, the clinical value of the S5 methylation classifier (S5), HPV genotyping and cytology were compared as potential triage tests, for outcomes of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or greater (CIN3+), CIN2+ and CIN2, and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. S5 scores increased with histopathology severity (Ptrend <.001). For CIN3+, the AUC was 0.780 suggesting S5 provides good discrimination between <CIN3 and CIN3+. AUCs were significant for all pairwise comparisons of <CIN2, CIN2 and CIN3+ (P <.001). The positive predictive value (PPV) of HPV16/18 genotyping for women with any abnormal cytology was greater than S5 (25.36% vs 20.87%, P =.005) for CIN3+, while sensitivity was substantially greater for S5 (83.33% vs 59.28%, P <.001). Restricting to women with abnormal cytology, but excluding those with high-grade cytology, both S5 and HPV16/18 provided CIN3+ PPVs high enough to recommend colposcopy. Triage with S5 also appeared useful for hrHPV positive women negative for HPV16/18 (CIN3+ PPV: 7.33%, sensitivity: 57.52%). S5 provided increased sensitivity for CIN3+ compared to HPV16/18 genotyping for hrHPV positive women, overall and when restricted to women with abnormal cytology, suggesting S5 may improve colposcopy referral. S5 also has the ability to distinguish between <CIN2, CIN2 and CIN3+, a finding of importance for managing CIN2, given the complexity and uncertainty associated with this diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to undertake a multidisciplinary characterization of the phenotype associated with SOX11 variants. Methods: Individuals with protein altering variants in SOX11 were identified through exome and genome sequencing and international data sharing. Deep clinical phenotyping was undertaken by referring clinicians. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC array. The expression pattern of SOX11 in developing human brain was defined using RNAscope. Results: We reported 38 new patients with SOX11 variants. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed as a feature of SOX11 syndrome. A distinctive pattern of blood DNA methylation was identified in SOX11 syndrome, separating SOX11 syndrome from other BAFopathies. Conclusion: SOX11 syndrome is a distinct clinical entity with characteristic clinical features and episignature differentiating it from BAFopathies.

AB  - Background: Rapid postnatal growth may result from exposure in utero or early life to adverse conditions and has been associated with diseases later in life and, in particular, with childhood obesity. DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming. Methods: Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings. Results: Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e−05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e−07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e−04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.

AB  - Genetic variation may impact on local DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, information about allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) within disease-related loci has been proposed to be useful for the interpretation of GWAS results. To explore mechanisms that may underlie associations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia risk CLU gene and verbal memory, one of the most affected cognitive domains in both conditions, we studied DNA methylation in a region between AD-associated SNPs rs9331888 and rs9331896 in 72 healthy individuals and 73 schizophrenia patients. Using single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing we assessed the haplotype-dependent ASM in this region. We then investigated whether its methylation could influence episodic verbal memory measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in these two cohorts. The region showed a complex methylation pattern, which was similar in healthy and schizophrenia individuals and unrelated to haplotypes. The pattern predicted memory scores in controls. The results suggest that epigenetic modifications within the CLU locus may play a role in memory variation, independent of ASM.

AB  - As genetic and environmental influences on schizophrenia might converge on DNA methylation (DNAm) within loci which are both associated with the disease and implicated in response to environmental stress, we examined whether DNAm within CYP17A1, a hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis gene which is situated within the schizophrenia risk locus 10q24.32, would mediate genetic and environmental effects on stress-related schizophrenia symptoms. DNAm within an exonic–intronic fragment of CYP17A1 was assessed in the blood of 66 schizophrenia patients and 63 controls using single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, the VNTR polymorphism of the AS3MT gene, a plausible causal variant within the 10q24.32 locus, was genotyped in extended patient and control samples (n = 700). The effects of local haplotype, VNTR and a polyenviromic risk score (PERS) on DNAm, episodic verbal memory, executive functions, depression, and suicidality of patients were assessed. Haplotype and PERS differentially influenced DNAm at four variably methylated sites identified within the fragment, with stochastic, additive, and allele-specific effects being found. An allele-specific DNAm at CpG-SNP rs3781286 mediated the relationship between the local haplotype and verbal fluency. Our findings do not confirm that the interrogated DNA fragment is a place where genetic and environmental risk factors converge to influence schizophrenia symptoms through DNAm.

AB  - DNA methylation (DNAm) is a plausible mechanism underlying cardiometabolic abnormalities, but evidence is limited among youth. This analysis included 410 offspring of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort followed up to two time points in late childhood/adolescence. At Time 1, DNAm was quantified in blood leukocytes at long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1), H19, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD-2), and at Time 2 in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). At each time point, cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed including lipid profiles, glucose, blood pressure, and anthropometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for LINE-1, H19, and 11β-HSD-2 to account for the repeated-measure outcomes. Linear regression models were conducted for the cross-sectional association between PPAR-α with the outcomes. DNAm at LINE-1 was associated with log glucose at site 1 [β = −0.029, p = 0.0006] and with log high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at site 3 [β = 0.063, p = 0.0072]. 11β-HSD-2 DNAm at site 4 was associated with log glucose (β = −0.018, p = 0.0018). DNAm at LINE-1 and 11β-HSD-2 was associated with few cardiometabolic risk factors among youth in a locus-specific manner. These findings underscore the potential for epigenetic biomarkers to increase our understanding of cardiometabolic risk earlier in life.

AB  - The use of DNA methylation signatures to predict chronological age and aging rate is of interest in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment, forensics, and anti-aging medicine. Although a large number of methylation markers are significantly associated with age, most age-prediction methods use a few markers selected based on either previously published studies or datasets containing methylation information. Here, we implemented reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression and a ridge regression model in a Bayesian framework that utilized phenotypic and methylation profiles simultaneously to predict chronological age. We used over 450,000 CpG sites from the whole blood of a large cohort of 4409 human individuals with a range of 10-101 years of age. Models were fitted using adjusted and un-adjusted methylation measurements for cell heterogeneity. Un-adjusted methylation scores delivered a significantly higher prediction accuracy than adjusted methylation data, with a correlation between age and predicted age of 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.54 years in un-adjusted data, and 0.90 (correlation) and 7.16 (RMSE) years in adjusted data. Reducing the number of predictors (CpG sites) through subset selection improved predictive power with a correlation of 0.98 and an RMSE of 2.98 years in the RKHS model. We found distinct global methylation patterns, with a significant increase in the proportion of methylated cytosines in CpG islands and a decreased proportion in other CpG types, including CpG shore, shelf, and open sea (P < 5e-06). Epigenetic drift seemed to be a widespread phenomenon as more than 97% of the age-associated methylation sites had heteroscedasticity. Apparent methylomic aging rate (AMAR) had a sex-specific pattern, with an increase in AMAR in females with age related to males. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Epigenetic alterations related to prenatal neurotoxic metals exposure may be key in understanding the origins of cognitive and neurobehavioral problems in children. Placental glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) methylation has been linked to neurobehavioral risk in early life, but has not been examined in response to neurotoxic metals exposure despite parallel lines of research showing metals exposure and NR3C1 methylation each contribute to a similar set of neurobehavioral phenotypes. Thus, we conducted a study of prenatal neurotoxic metals exposure and placental NR3C1 methylation in a cohort of healthy term singleton pregnancies from Rhode Island, USA (n = 222). Concentrations of arsenic (As; median 0.02 ug/g), cadmium (Cd; median 0.03 mug/g), lead (Pb; median 0.40 mug/g), manganese (Mn; median 0.56 mug/g), mercury (Hg; median 0.02 mug/g), and zinc (Zn; 145.18 mug/g) measured in infant toenails were categorized as tertiles. Multivariable linear regression models tested the independent associations for each metal with NR3C1 methylation, as well as the cumulative risk of exposure to multiple metals simultaneously. Compared to the lowest exposure tertiles, higher levels of As, Cd, Pb, Mn, and Hg were each associated with increased placental NR3C1 methylation (all P<0.02). Coefficients for these associations corresponded with a 0.71-1.41 percent increase in NR3C1 methylation per tertile increase in metals concentrations. For Zn, the lowest exposure tertile compared with the highest tertile was associated with 1.26 percent increase in NR3C1 methylation (P=0.01). Higher cumulative metal risk scores were marginally associated with greater NR3C1 methylation. Taken together, these results indicate that prenatal exposure to neurotoxic metals may affect the offspring's NR3C1 activity, which may help explain cognitive and neurodevelopmental risk later in life.

AB  - Conventional genetic testing of individuals with neurodevelopmental presentations and congenital anomalies (ND/CAs), i.e., the analysis of sequence and copy number variants, leaves a substantial proportion of them unexplained. Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNA methylation defects at a single locus (epi-variants), while others can exhibit syndrome-specific DNA methylation changes across multiple loci (epi-signatures). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unresolved ND/CAs. We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model in resolving 67 individuals with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases and highlights the potential value of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assessment of ND/CAs.

AB  - Nontruncating sequence variants represent a major challenge in variant interpretation and classification. Here, we report a patient with features of Kabuki syndrome who carries two rare heterozygous variants in KMT2D: c.12935C>T, p.(Ser4312Phe) and c.15785-10T>G. The clinical significance of these variants were discordantly interpreted by different diagnostic laboratories. Parental testing showed that the missense variant was inherited from the father with a mild Kabuki phenotype and the intronic variant from the mother with mosaic status. Through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood, we confirmed that the proband exhibited a previously described episignature of Kabuki syndrome. Parental samples had normal DNA methylation profiles, thus ruling out the involvement of the paternally inherited missense variant. RNA analysis revealed that the intronic change resulted in exon 49 skipping and frameshift, thereby providing a molecular diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome. This study demonstrates the utility of epigenomic and RNA analyses in resolving ambiguous clinical cases. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Genetic syndromes frequently present with overlapping clinical features and inconclusive or ambiguous genetic findings which can confound accurate diagnosis and clinical management. An expanding number of genetic syndromes have been shown to have unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called "episignatures"). Peripheral blood episignatures can be used for diagnostic testing as well as for the interpretation of ambiguous genetic test results. We present here an approach to episignature mapping in 42 genetic syndromes, which has allowed the identification of 34 robust disease-specific episignatures. We examine emerging patterns of overlap, as well as similarities and hierarchical relationships across these episignatures, to highlight their key features as they are related to genetic heterogeneity, dosage effect, unaffected carrier status, and incomplete penetrance. We demonstrate the necessity of multiclass modeling for accurate genetic variant classification and show how disease classification using a single episignature at a time can sometimes lead to classification errors in closely related episignatures. We demonstrate the utility of this tool in resolving ambiguous clinical cases and identification of previously undiagnosed cases through mass screening of a large cohort of subjects with developmental delays and congenital anomalies. This study more than doubles the number of published syndromes with DNA methylation episignatures and, most significantly, opens new avenues for accurate diagnosis and clinical assessment in individuals affected by these disorders.

AB  - Pediatric developmental syndromes present with systemic, complex, and often overlapping clinical features that are not infrequently a consequence of Mendelian inheritance of mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation, establishment of histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling (the “epigenetic machinery”). The mechanistic cross-talk between histone modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures, we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical and molecular features associated with the disruption of the epigenetic machinery.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a high risk of developing chronic diseases and decreased life expectancy, but no ACE epigenetic biomarkers have been identified until now. The latter may result from the interaction of multiple factors such as age, sex, degree of adversity, and lack of transcriptional effects of DNA methylation changes. We hypothesize that DNA methylation changes are related to childhood adversity levels and current age, and these markers evolve as aging proceeds. Two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, regarding ACE, were selected (GSE72680 and GSE70603), considering raw- and meta-data availability, including validated ACE index (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) score). For DNA methylation, analyzed probes were restricted to those laying within promoters and first exons, and samples were grouped by CTQ scores terciles, to compare highly (ACE) with non-abused (control) cases. Comparison of control and ACE methylome profile did not retrieve differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) after correcting by false discovery rate < 0.05, and this was also observed when samples were separated by sex. In contrast, grouping by decade age ranges (i.e., the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) showed a progressive increase in the number of DMCs and the intensity of changes, mainly related with hypomethylation. Comparison with transcriptome data for ACE subjects in the 40s, and 50s showed a similar age-dependent effect. This study provides evidence that epigenetic markers of ACE are age-dependent, but not defined in the long term. These differences among early, middle, and late adulthood epigenomic profiles suggest a window for interventions aimed to prevent the detrimental effects of ACE.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprise a group of heterogeneous and complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD etiology. DNA methylation is particularly relevant for ASD due to its mediating role in the complex interaction between genotype and environment and has been implicated in ASD pathophysiology. The lack of diversity in DNA methylation studies in ASD individuals is remarkable. Since genetic and environmental factors are likely to vary across populations, the study of underrepresented populations is necessary to understand the molecular alterations involved in ASD and the risk factors underlying these changes. This study explored genome-wide differences in DNA methylation patterns in buccal epithelium cells between Mexican ASD patients (n = 27) and age-matched typically developing (TD: n = 15) children. DNA methylation profiles were evaluated with the Illumina 450k array. We evaluated the interaction between sex and ASD and found a differentially methylated region (DMR) over the 5'UTR region of ZFP57 and one of its targets, RASGRF2. These results match previous findings in brain tissue, which may indicate that ZFP57 could be used as a proxy for DNA methylation in different tissues. This is the first study performed in a Mexican, and subsequently, Latin American, population that evaluates DNA methylation in ASD patients.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in KANSL1 and 17q21.31 microdeletions are causative of Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS), a neurodevelopmental syndrome with characteristic facial dysmorphia. Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes have identifiable patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) change: DNAm signatures or episignatures. Given the role of KANSL1 in histone acetylation, we tested whether variants underlying KdVS are associated with a DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 13 individuals with KANSL1 variants, four individuals with 17q21.31 microdeletions, and 21 typically developing individuals, using Illumina’s Infinium EPIC array. In this study, we identified a robust DNAm signature of 456 significant CpG sites in 8 individuals with KdVS, a pattern independently validated in an additional 7 individuals with KdVS. We also demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the signature and classify two KANSL1 VUS as well as four variants in individuals with atypical clinical presentation. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific DNAm changes in fibroblast cells from individuals with KdVS. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the epigenetic landscape related to KdVS and aid in the diagnosis and classification of variants in this structurally complex genomic region.

AB  - The ZAC1 gene, mapped to the 6q24 region, is part of a network of co-regulated imprinted genes involved in the control of embryonic growth. Loss of methylation at the ZAC1 differentially methylated region (DMR) is associated with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, a developmental disorder involving growth retardation and diabetes in the first weeks of post-natal life. We assessed whether the degree of methylation of the ZAC1 DMR in leukocytes DNA extracted from cord blood is associated with fetal, birth and post-natal anthropometric measures or with C-peptide concentrations in cord serum. We also searched for an influence of dietary intake and maternal parameters on ZAC1 DMR methylation. We found positive correlations between the ZAC1 DMR methylation index (MI) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 32 weeks of gestation, weight at birth and weight at one year of age (respectively, r = 0.15, 0.09, 0.14; P values = 0.01, 0.15, 0.03). However, there were no significant correlations between the ZAC1 DMR MI and cord blood C-peptide levels. Maternal intakes of alcohol and of vitamins B2 were positively correlated with ZAC1 DMR methylation (respectively, r = 0.2 and 0.14; P = 0.004 and 0.04). The influence of ZAC1 seems to start in the second half of pregnancy and continue at least until the first year of life. The maternal environment also appears to contribute to the regulation of DNA methylation. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Exposure in utero to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is associated with maladaptive health outcomes. Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n = 749) and 15 (n = 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158, p = 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095, p = 0.06) across all participants. The PM10 findings were driven by the age 15 subset where an interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a -0.024 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.043, -0.005, p = 0.012). Findings were robust to adjustment for PM exposure at ages 1 and 3. In utero PM10-associated DNA methylation differences were identified at age 15 in saliva. Benchmarking the timing and cell-type generalizability is critical for epigenetic exposure biomarker assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women facing increased energetic demands in childhood commonly have altered adult ovarian activity and shorter reproductive lifespan, possibly comprising a strategy to optimize reproductive success. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of early-life programming of reproductive function, by integrating analysis of reproductive tissues in an appropriate mouse model with methylation analysis of proxy tissue DNA in a well-characterized population of Bangladeshi migrants in the UK. Bangladeshi women whose childhood was in Bangladesh were found to have later pubertal onset and lower age-matched ovarian reserve than Bangladeshi women who grew-up in England. Subsequently, we aimed to explore the potential relevance to the altered reproductive phenotype of one of the genes that emerged from the screens. RESULTS: Of the genes associated with differential methylation in the Bangladeshi women whose childhood was in Bangladesh as compared to Bangladeshi women who grew up in the UK, 13 correlated with altered expression of the orthologous gene in the mouse model ovaries. These mice had delayed pubertal onset and a smaller ovarian reserve compared to controls. The most relevant of these genes for reproductive function appeared to be SRD5A1, which encodes the steroidogenic enzyme 5alpha reductase-1. SRD5A1 was more methylated at the same transcriptional enhancer in mice ovaries as in the women's buccal DNA, and its expression was lower in the hypothalamus of the mice as well, suggesting a possible role in the central control of reproduction. The expression of Kiss1 and Gnrh was also lower in these mice compared to controls, and inhibition of 5alpha reductase-1 reduced Kiss1 and Gnrh mRNA levels and blocked GnRH release in GnRH neuronal cell cultures. Crucially, we show that inhibition of this enzyme in female mice in vivo delayed pubertal onset. CONCLUSIONS: SRD5A1/5alpha reductase-1 responds epigenetically to the environment and its downregulation appears to alter the reproductive phenotype. These findings help to explain diversity in reproductive characteristics and how they are shaped by early-life environment and reveal novel pathways that might be targeted to mitigate health issues caused by life-history trade-offs.

AB  - Reproductive function adjusts in response to environmental conditions in order to optimize success. In humans, this plasticity includes age of pubertal onset, hormone levels and age at menopause. These reproductive characteristics vary across populations with distinct lifestyles and following specific childhood events, and point to a role for the early-life environment in shaping adult reproductive trajectories. Epigenetic mechanisms respond to external signals, exert long-term effects on gene expression and have been shown in animal and cellular studies to regulate normal reproductive function, strongly implicating their role in these adaptations. Moreover, human cohort data have revealed differential DNA methylation signatures in proxy tissues that are associated with reproductive phenotypic variation, although the cause-effect relationships are difficult to discern, calling for additional complementary approaches to establish functionality. In this Review, we summarize how adult reproductive function can be shaped by childhood events. We discuss why the influence of the childhood environment on adult reproductive function is an important consideration in understanding how reproduction is regulated and necessitates consideration by clinicians treating women with diverse life histories. The resolution of the molecular mechanisms responsible for human reproductive plasticity could also lead to new approaches for intervention by targeting these epigenetic modifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with time-varying environmental factors that contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD) risk. We sought to test whether DNAm signatures of lifestyle and biochemical factors were associated with MDD to reveal dynamic biomarkers of MDD risk that may be amenable to lifestyle interventions. METHODS: Here, we calculated methylation scores (MS) at multiple p-value thresholds for lifestyle (BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational attainment) and biochemical (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol) factors in Generation Scotland (GS) (N=9,502) and in a replication cohort (ALSPACadults, N=565), using CpG sites reported in previous well-powered methylome-wide association studies. We also compared their predictive accuracy for MDD to a MDD MS in an independent GS sub-sample (N=4,432). FINDINGS: Each trait MS was significantly associated with its corresponding phenotype in GS (betarange=0.089-1.457) and in ALSPAC (betarange=0.078-2.533). Each MS was also significantly associated with MDD before and after adjustment for its corresponding phenotype in GS (betarange=0.053-0.145). After accounting for relevant lifestyle factors, MS for educational attainment (beta=0.094) and alcohol consumption (MSp-value<0.01-0.5; betarange=-0.069-0.083) remained significantly associated with MDD in GS. Smoking (AUC=0.569) and educational attainment (AUC=0.585) MSs could discriminate MDD from controls better than the MDD MS (AUC=0.553) in the independent GS sub-sample. Analyses implicating MDD did not replicate across ALSPAC, although the direction of effect was consistent for all traits when adjusting for the MS corresponding phenotypes. INTERPRETATION: We showed that lifestyle and biochemical MS were associated with MDD before and after adjustment for their corresponding phenotypes (pnominal<0.05), but not when smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI were also included as covariates. MDD results did not replicate in the smaller, female-only independent ALSPAC cohort (NALSPAC=565; NGS=9,502), potentially due to demographic differences or low statistical power, but effect sizes were consistent with the direction reported in GS. DNAm scores for modifiable MDD risk factors may contribute to disease vulnerability and, in some cases, explain additional variance to their observed phenotypes. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.

AB  - Potentially traumatic experiences have been associated with chronic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (n = 236) and their children aged 3–5 years (n = 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory—Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on the ENOX1 gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes.

AB  - Novel approaches to uncover the molecular etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are highly needed. Even using a powerful tool such as whole exome sequencing (WES), the diagnostic process may still prove long and arduous due to the high clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these conditions. The main strategies to improve the diagnostic rate are based on family segregation, re-evaluation of the clinical features by reverse-phenotyping, re-analysis of unsolved NGS-based cases and epigenetic functional studies. In this article, we described three selected cases from a cohort of patients with NDD in which trio WES was applied, in order to underline the typical challenges encountered during the diagnostic process: (1) an ultra-rare condition caused by a missense variant in MEIS2, identified through the updated Solve-RD re-analysis; (2) a patient with Noonan-like features in which the NGS analysis revealed a novel variant in NIPBL causing Cornelia de Lange syndrome; and (3) a case with de novo variants in genes involved in the chromatin-remodeling complex, for which the study of the epigenetic signature excluded a pathogenic role. In this perspective, we aimed to (i) provide an example of the relevance of the genetic re-analysis of all unsolved cases through network projects on rare diseases; (ii) point out the role and the uncertainties of the reverse phenotyping in the interpretation of the genetic results; and (iii) describe the use of methylation signatures in neurodevelopmental syndromes for the validation of the variants of uncertain significance.

AB  - In 785 mother-child (50% male) pairs from a longitudinal epidemiological birth cohort, we investigated associations between inflammation-related epigenetic polygenic risk scores (i-ePGS), environmental exposures, cognitive function, and child and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. We examined prenatal and postnatal effects. For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects. The present study supports a link between i-ePGS and child and adolescent mental health.

AB  - Background: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterised by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Loss of DNA methylation at the telomeric imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) on 11p15 is an important cause of SRS. Methods: We studied the methylation pattern at the H19-IGF2 locus in 201 patients with suspected SRS. In an attempt to categorise the patients into different subgroups, we developed a simple clinical scoring system with respect to readily and unambiguously assessable clinical features. In a second step, the relationship between clinical score and epigenetic status was analysed. Results and conclusions: The scoring system emerged as a powerful tool for identifying those patients with both a definite SRS phenotype and carrying an epimutation at 11p15. 53% of the 201 patients initially enrolled fulfilled the criteria for SRS and about 40% of them exhibited an epimutation at the H19-IGF2 locus. Methylation defects were restricted to patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SRS. Patients carrying epimutations had a more severe phenotype than either the SRS patients with mUPD7 or the idiopathic SRS patients. The majority of patients with methylation abnormalities showed hypomethylation at both the H19 and IGF2 genes. However, we also identified SRS patients where hypomethylation was restricted to either the H19 or the IGF2 gene. Interestingly, we detected epimutations in siblings of normal parents, most likely reflecting germ cell mosaicism in the fathers. In one family, we identified an epimutation in an affected father and his likewise affected daughter.

AB  - Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Epigenetic changes can be induced by environmental exposures such as inflammation. Here we tested the hypothesis that prenatal inflammation, a recognized risk factor for schizophrenia and related neurodevelopmental conditions, alters DNA methylation in key brain regions linked to schizophrenia, namely the dopamine rich striatum and endocrine regulatory centre, the hypothalamus. DNA methylation across highly repetitive elements (long interspersed element 1 (LINE1) and intracisternal A-particles (IAPs)) were used to proxy global DNA methylation. We also investigated the Mecp2 gene because it regulates transcription of LINE1 and has a known association with neurodevelopmental disorders. Brain tissue was harvested from 6 week old offspring of mice exposed to the viral analog PolyI:C or saline on gestation day 9. We used Sequenom EpiTYPER assay to quantitatively analyze differences in DNA methylation at IAPs, LINE1 elements and the promoter region of Mecp2. In the hypothalamus, prenatal exposure to PolyI:C caused significant global DNA hypomethylation (t=2.44, P=0.019, PolyI:C mean 69.67%, saline mean 70.19%), especially in females, and significant hypomethylation of the promoter region of Mecp2, (t=3.32, P=0.002; PolyI:C mean 26.57%, saline mean 34.63%). IAP methylation was unaltered. DNA methylation in the striatum was not significantly altered. This study provides the first experimental evidence that exposure to inflammation during prenatal life is associated with epigenetic changes, including Mecp2 promoter hypomethylation. This suggests that environmental and genetic risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders may act upon similar pathways. This is important because epigenetic changes are potentially modifiable and their investigation may open new avenues for treatment.

AB  - Deregulation of the microRNA miR124a by DNA methylation has been implicated in various malignancies, but no study reported its methylation status in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We evaluated the methylation of the three loci encoding for miR124a using methylation-specific PCR in 64 HL patients and 15 reactive lymph nodes obtained from patients with nonmalignant diseases. Results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Methylation rates of miR124a-1, miR124a-2, and miR124a-3 in HL were 17, 50, and 28%, respectively. None of the nontumoral samples showed aberrant hypermethylation in any of the miR tested. In HL cases, we found that miR124a-1 methylation correlates with high-risk International Prognostic Score (IPS) (score >3, p = 0.04) and that miR124a-2 methylation was more frequent in children (82.3%, p = 0.006) and men (63.9%, p = 0.01). Methylation of miR124a-3 was associated with advanced Ann-Arbor stages (p = 0.007). The survival analysis showed that methylation of at least one of the miR124a genes was associated with shortened event-free survival in univariate (p = 0.03) and multivariate (p = 0.02) analyses. These results suggest that miR124a methylation is associated with aggressive HL disease and may be an interesting factor for predicting treatment response.

AB  - Background: Preterm infants who receive differential red blood cell (RBC) transfusions at birth may show brain structure differences across development, including abnormalities in white matter (WM) structure and organization. This study investigated long-term outcomes of brain structure in female infants born preterm, at an average age of 13 years old, who received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the neonatal period according to a liberal or restrictive approach. Results from this study will increase understanding of the effects of transfusion on the developing brain. Study design and methods: This follow-up study included female preterm infants who participated in a clinical trial and had been randomized at birth to either a liberal or restrictive hematocrit threshold. Brain structures were measured in childhood using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Due to the low number of females in the restrictive transfusion group at follow-up, additional females were recruited for inclusion. Main outcome measures included cerebral and subcortical brain region volumes. Results: Total intracranial volume was significantly decreased in females who were randomized to higher average hematocrit levels at birth. Infants in the liberal transfusion group had proportionately smaller volumes in all measures of regional cerebral WM and subcortical brain volumes, reaching significance for temporal lobe WM and caudate volumes. Conclusion: Female premature infants who received a liberal transfusion threshold at birth had decreased WM volumes, which suggests the potential long-term neurodevelopmental risks associated with liberal transfusion practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ADNP syndrome is a rare Mendelian disorder characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. It is caused by truncating mutations in ADNP, which is involved in chromatin regulation. We hypothesized that the disruption of chromatin regulation might result in specific DNA methylation patterns that could be used in the molecular diagnosis of ADNP syndrome. RESULTS: We identified two distinct and partially opposing genomic DNA methylation episignatures in the peripheral blood samples from 22 patients with ADNP syndrome. The "epi-ADNP-1" episignature included ~ 6000 mostly hypomethylated CpGs, and the "epi-ADNP-2" episignature included ~ 1000 predominantly hypermethylated CpGs. The two signatures correlated with the locations of the ADNP mutations. Epi-ADNP-1 mutations occupy the N- and C-terminus, and epi-ADNP-2 mutations are centered on the nuclear localization signal. The episignatures were enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A classifier trained on these profiles yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with either of the two episignatures. Applying this model to seven patients with uncertain clinical diagnosis enabled reclassification of genetic variants of uncertain significance and assigned new diagnosis when the primary clinical suspicion was not correct. When applied to a large cohort of unresolved patients with developmental delay (N = 1150), the model predicted three additional previously undiagnosed patients to have ADNP syndrome. DNA sequencing of these subjects, wherever available, identified pathogenic mutations within the gene domains predicted by the model. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first Mendelian condition with two distinct episignatures caused by mutations in a single gene. These highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignatures enable diagnosis, screening, and genetic variant classifications in ADNP syndrome.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error and bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalised linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates.

AB  - Context: SDHB mutations are found in an increasing number of neoplasms, most notably in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (PPGLs). SDHB-PPGLs are slow-growing tumors, but ∼50% of them may develop metastasis. The molecular basis of metastasis in these tumors is a long-standing and unresolved problem. Thus, a better understanding of the biology of metastasis is needed. Objective: This study aimed to identify gene methylation changes relevant for metastatic SDHB-PPGLs. Design: We performed genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in diverse clinical and genetic PPGL subtypes, and validated protocadherin γ-C3 (PCDHGC3) gene promoter methylation in metastatic SDHB-PPGLs. Results: We define an epigenetic landscape specific for metastatic SDHB-PPGLs. DNA methylation levels were found significantly higher in metastatic SDHB-PPGLs than in SDHB-PPGLs without metastases. One such change included long-range de novo methylation of the PCDHA, PCDHB, and PCDHG gene clusters. High levels of PCDHGC3 promoter methylation were validated in primary metastatic SDHB-PPGLs, it was found amplified in the corresponding metastases, and it was significantly correlated with PCDHGC3 reduced expression. Interestingly, this epigenetic alteration could be detected in primary tumors that developed metastasis several years later. We also show that PCDHGC3 down regulation engages metastasis-initiating capabilities by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusions: Our data provide a map of the DNA methylome episignature specific to an SDHB-mutated cancer and establish PCDHGC3 as a putative suppressor gene and a potential biomarker to identify patients with SDHB-mutated cancer at high risk of metastasis who might benefit from future targeted therapies.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autistic spectrum disorder, is typically caused by transcriptional silencing of the X-linked FMR1 gene. Work in animal models has described altered synaptic plasticity, a result of the up-regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling, as a putative downstreameffect. Post hoc analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2 trial suggested that the selective mGluR5 antagonist mavoglurant improved behavioral symptoms in FXS patients with completely methylated FMR1 genes. We present the results of two phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group studies of mavoglurant in FXS, designed to confirmthis result in adults (n = 175, aged 18 to 45 years) and adolescents (n = 139, aged 12 to 17 years). In both trials, participants were stratified by methylation status and randomized to receive mavoglurant (25, 50, or 100 mg twice daily) or placebo over 12 weeks. Neither of the studies achieved the primary efficacy end point of improvement on behavioral symptoms measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition using the FXS-specific algorithm (ABC-CFX) after 12 weeks of treatment with mavoglurant. The safety and tolerability profile of mavoglurant was as previously described, with fewadverse events. Therefore, under the conditions of our study, we could not confirmthemGluR theory of FXS nor the ability of the methylation state of the FMR1 promoter to predictmavoglurant efficacy. Preclinical results suggest that future clinical trials might profitably explore initiating treatment in a younger population with longer treatment duration and longer placebo run-ins and identifying new markers to better assess behavioral and cognitive benefits.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has recently been linked to increased methylation levels in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, and OXTR hypermethylation has predicted a worse treatment response to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Furthermore, OCD is associated with childhood trauma and stressful life events, which have both been shown to affect OXTR methylation. Here, we aimed to replicate findings of increased OXTR methylation as a predictor of disease and worse treatment response in an independent sample that received treatment within the public health care system. In addition, we aimed to extend previous findings by examining associations between OXTR hypermethylation, environmental stressors, OCD diagnosis, and treatment response. Methylation levels at two CpGs within OXTR exon III were compared between n = 181 OCD patients and n = 199 healthy controls using linear regression analysis. In a subsample of OCD patients (n = 98) with documented treatment data, we examined associations between methylation and treatment response to CBT. Childhood adversity and stressful life events were assessed using Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Life Experience Survey, respectively. OCD patients exhibited significant hypermethylation at CpG site cg04523291 compared to controls, and increased methylation was associated with impaired treatment response. Moreover, hypermethylation at cg04523291 was associated with stressful life events in OCD patients, and with childhood adversity in controls. Yet, there were no significant mediation effects. In conclusion, we replicated the association between OXTR hypermethylation and OCD in the largest sample, so far. Furthermore, our findings support the role of OXTR methylation as a promising biomarker for treatment response in OCD.

AB  - Background: Imprinting disorders (ImpDis) comprise diseases which are caused by aberrant regulation of monoallelically and parent-of-origin-dependent expressed genes. A characteristic molecular change in ImpDis patients is aberrant methylation signatures at disease-specific loci, without an obvious DNA change at the specific differentially methylated region (DMR). However, there is a growing number of reports on multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLIDs), i.e. aberrant methylation at different DMRs in the same patient. These MLIDs account for a significant number of patients with specific ImpDis, and several reports indicate a central role of pathogenic maternal effect variants in their aetiology by affecting the maturation of the oocyte and the early embryo. Though several studies on the prevalence and the molecular causes of MLID have been conducted, homogeneous datasets comprising both genomic and methylation data are still lacking. Results: Based on a cohort of 36 MLID patients, we here present both methylation data obtained from next-generation sequencing (NGS, ImprintSeq) approaches and whole-exome sequencing (WES). The compilation of methylation data did not reveal a disease-specific MLID episignature, and a predisposition for the phenotypic modification was not obvious as well. In fact, this lack of epigenotype–phenotype correlation might be related to the mosaic distribution of imprinting defects and their functional relevance in specific tissues. Conclusions: Due to the higher sensitivity of NGS-based approaches, we suggest that ImprintSeq might be offered at reference centres in case of ImpDis patients with unusual phenotypes but MLID negative by conventional tests. By WES, additional MLID causes than the already known maternal effect variants could not be identified, neither in the patients nor in the maternal exomes. In cases with negative WES results, it is currently unclear to what extent either environmental factors or undetected genetic variants contribute to MLID.

AB  - Prenatal maternal smoking is associated with low birthweight, neurological disorders, and asthma in exposed children. DNA methylation signatures can function as biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure. However, the robustness of DNA methylation signatures across child ages, genetic ancestry groups, or tissues is not clear. Using coefficients from a meta-analysis of prenatal smoke exposure and DNA methylation in newborn cord blood, we created polymethylation scores of saliva DNA methylation from children at ages 9 and 15 in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. In the full sample at age 9 (n = 753), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.51 (95%CI: 0.35, 0.66) standard deviation higher polymethylation score. The direction and magnitude of the association was consistent in European and African genetic ancestry samples. In the full sample at age 15 (n = 747), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.48 (95%CI: 0.32, 0.63) standard deviation higher polymethylation score, and the association was attenuated among the European and Admixed-Latin genetic ancestry samples. The polymethylation score classified prenatal smoke exposure accurately (AUC age 9 = 0.77, age 15 = 0.76). Including the polymethylation score increased the AUC of base model covariates by 5 (95% CI: (2.1, 7.2)) percentage points, while including a single candidate site in the AHRR gene did not (P-value = 0.19). Polymethylation scores for prenatal smoking were portable across genetic ancestries and more accurate than an individual DNA methylation site. Polymethylation scores from saliva samples could serve as robust and practical biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure.

AB  - SRSF1 (also known as ASF/SF2) is a non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (non-snRNP) that belongs to the arginine/serine (R/S) domain family. It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Transcriptomic research of blood cell lineages supports the understanding of distinct features of the immunopathology in human malaria. Methods: We used microarray hybridization, validated by real-time RT-PCR to analyze whole blood gene expression in healthy Gabonese children and children with various conditions of Plasmodium falciparum infection, including i) asymptomatic infection, ii) uncomplicated malaria, iii) malaria associated with severe anemia and iv) cerebral malaria. Findings: Our data indicate that the expression profile of 22 genes significantly differed among the investigated groups. Immunoglobulin production, complement regulation and IFN beta signaling, in particular IRF7 and ISRE binding signatures in the corresponding genes, were most conspicuous. Down-regulation in cerebral malaria seems to rely on AhRF, GABP and HIF1 hypoxia transcription factors. ARG1, BPI, CD163, IFI27, HP and TNFAIP6 transcript levels correlated positively with lactatemia, and negatively with hemoglobin concentrations. Interpretation: Differences in gene expression profile reflect distinct immunopathological mechanisms of P. falciparum infection. They emerge as potential prognostic markers for early therapeutic measures and need to be validated further.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disadvantaged socio-economic position (SEP) in childhood is associated with increased adult mortality and morbidity. We aimed to establish whether childhood SEP was associated with differential methylation of adult DNA. METHODS: Forty adult males from the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study were selected from SEP extremes in both early childhood and mid-adulthood. We performed genome-wide methylation analysis on blood DNA taken at 45 years using MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation). We mapped in triplicate the methylation state of promoters of approximately 20,000 genes and 400 microRNAs. Probe methylation scores were averaged across triplicates and differential methylation between groups of individuals was determined. Differentially methylated promoter sites of selected genes were validated using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA. RESULTS: Variably methylated probes (9112 from n = 223,359 on the microarray) corresponded to 6176 gene promoters with at least one variable probe. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of probes obtained from the 500 most variable promoters revealed a cluster enriched with high SEP individuals confirming that SEP differences contribute to overall epigenetic variation. Methylation levels for 1252 gene promoters were associated with childhood SEP vs 545 promoters for adulthood SEP. Functionally, associations with childhood SEP appear in promoters of genes enriched in key cell signalling pathways. The differentially methylated promoters associated with SEP cluster in megabase-sized regions of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: Adult blood DNA methylation profiles show more associations with childhood SEP than adult SEP. Organization of these associations across the genome suggests a well-defined epigenetic pattern linked to early socio-economic environment.

AB  - Simple Summary A subset of patients with an intermediate risk for renal cell carcinoma have an indolent disease course. For these patients, the initiation of treatment for metastatic disease can be safely delayed by entering a watchful waiting period. At present, we are not able to identify those patients with indolent disease and the minor group of patients with rapidly progressive disease requiring earlier initiation of systemic treatment. In this study, we investigate whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used as a blood-based biomarker to identify those patients with rapid progression. Methylated cfDNA profiles were used as a proxy for tumor load in blood. cfDNA methylation patterns were associated with the time to radiological progression, but not with the watchful waiting time. The results of this study do not provide definite proof that cfDNA methylation patterns are associated with WW time. According to the current guidelines, watchful waiting (WW) is a feasible option for patients with good or intermediate prognosis renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). However, some patients rapidly progress during WW, requiring the initiation of treatment. Here, we explore whether we can identify those patients using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation. We first defined a panel of RCC-specific circulating methylation markers by intersecting differentially methylated regions from a publicly available dataset with known RCC methylation markers from the literature. The resulting RCC-specific methylation marker panel of 22 markers was subsequently evaluated for an association with rapid progression by methylated DNA sequencing (MeD-seq) in serum from 10 HBDs and 34 RCC patients with a good or intermediate prognosis starting WW in the IMPACT-RCC study. Patients with an elevated RCC-specific methylation score compared to HBDs had a shorter progression-free survival (PFS, p = 0.018), but not a shorter WW-time (p = 0.15). Cox proportional hazards regression showed that only the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria were significantly associated with WW time (HR 2.01, p = 0.01), whereas only our RCC-specific methylation score (HR 4.45, p = 0.02) was significantly associated with PFS. The results of this study suggest that cfDNA methylation is predictive of PFS but not WW.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of epigenetics and transcriptional activity in adolescents may provide knowledge about possible preventive strategies of depression. METHODS: We present a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) and cohort validation analysis of depression in adolescents, in two separate cohorts: discovery (n=93) and validation data set 1 (n=78). The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured from whole blood using the Illumina 450K array. A second validation cohort, validation data set 2, consists of post-mortem brain biopsies from depressed adults (n=58). We performed a MWAS by robust multiple linear regressions of methylation to a modified risk-score assessment of depression. Methylation levels of candidate CpG sites were correlated with expression levels of the associated gene in an independent cohort of 11 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The methylation state of two CpG sites reliably predicted ratings of depression in adolescents (cg13227623 and cg04102384) (p<10E-06). Cohort validation analysis confirmed cg04102384 - located in the promoter region of microRNA 4646 (MIR4646) - to be hypomethylated in both validation data set 1 and validation data set 2 (p<0.05). Cg04102384 was inversely correlated to expression levels of MIR4646-3p in healthy controls (p<0.05). LIMITATIONS: MIR4646 was not differentially expressed in a subset of samples with adolescent depression measured by qRT-PCR measurements. CONCLUSION: We identify a specific MIR4646 associated epigenetic risk site to be associated with depression in adolescents. Cg04102384 putatively regulates gene expression of MIR4646-3p. Target gene prediction and gene set overrepresentation analysis revealed involvement of this miRNA in fatty acid elongation, a process related to omega-3 fatty acids, previously associated with depression.

AB  - The lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B) gene product is important for epigenetic modifications associated with active gene transcription in normal development and in maintaining proper neural function. Pathogenic variants in KMT2B have been associated with childhood-onset Dystonia-28 and Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 68 (MRD 68) for cases of neurodevelopmental impairment without dystonia (DYT28; OMIM 617284 and MRD68; OMIM 619934, respectively). Since its first description in 2016, approximately one hundred KMT2B genetic variants have been reported with heterogeneous phenotypes, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotypes. KMT2B-related disorders share many overlapping phenotypic characteristics with other neurodevelopmental disorders and delayed dystonia, that can appear later in childhood, often delaying clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, conventional genetic testing may not always provide actionable information (e.g., gene panel selection based on early clinical presentation or variants of uncertain significance), which prevents patients and families from obtaining early access to treatments and support. Herein, we describe the early diagnosis of KMT2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder by DNA methylation episignature testing in a 4-year-old patient without features of dystonia at diagnosis, which is reported to develop in more than 80% of KMT2B-related disorder cases. The proband, a 4-year-old female of Jewish-Israeli descent, presented with speech delay, microcephaly, poor weight gain, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, dysmorphism, intellectual disabilities and joint hyperlaxity, but presented no signs of dystonia at initial evaluation. Episignature screening in this pre-symptomatic patient enabled accurate genetic diagnosis and timely and actionable intervention earlier in the natural history of Childhood-onset Dystonia-28.

AB  - Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with intellectual disability/developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple medical comorbidities. HVDAS is caused by mutations in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). A recent study identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 22 individuals with HVDAS, adding to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders with an epigenetic signature. This methylation signature segregated those with HVDAS into two groups based on the location of the mutations. Here, we conducted an independent study on 24 individuals with HVDAS and replicated the existence of the two mutation-dependent episignatures. To probe whether the two distinct episignatures correlate with clinical outcomes, we used deep behavioral and neurobiological data from two prospective cohorts of individuals with a genetic diagnosis of HVDAS. We found limited phenotypic differences between the two HVDAS-affected groups and no evidence that individuals with more widespread methylation changes are more severely affected. Moreover, in spite of the methylation changes, we observed no profound alterations in the blood transcriptome of individuals with HVDAS. Our data warrant caution in harnessing methylation signatures in HVDAS as a tool for clinical stratification, at least with regard to behavioral phenotypes.

AB  - Background/Aims: Temple syndrome is an imprinting disorder caused by maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 (mat UPD14), paternal deletion of 14q32 or paternal hypomethylation of the intergenic differentially methylated region (MEG3/DLK1 IG-DMR). Patients with Temple syndrome have pre-and postnatal growth restriction, short stature, hypotonia, small hands and feet and precocious puberty. We sought to determine whether treatment with growth hormone improves growth outcomes in patients with Temple syndrome. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study reviewing the medical records of 14 patients with Temple syndrome, 7 of whom were treated with growth hormone. Results: After 1 year of growth hormone treatment, the height standard deviation score (SDS) increased a median of 1.31 SDS with a median increased height velocity of 5.30 cm/year. Conclusions: These results suggest short-term improvement in height SDS with growth hormone treatment similar to the response in patients treated under the small for gestational age indication. We recommend considering growth hormone therapy in all patients with Temple syndrome who have short stature.

AB  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a human genomic imprinting disorder, is characterized by phenotypic variability that might include overgrowth, macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, neonatal hypoglycaemia, lateralized overgrowth and predisposition to embryonal tumours. Delineation of the molecular defects within the imprinted 11p15.5 region can predict familial recurrence risks and the risk (and type) of embryonal tumour. Despite recent advances in knowledge, there is marked heterogeneity in clinical diagnostic criteria and care. As detailed in this Consensus Statement, an international consensus group agreed upon 72 recommendations for the clinical and molecular diagnosis and management of BWS, including comprehensive protocols for the molecular investigation, care and treatment of patients from the prenatal period to adulthood. The consensus recommendations apply to patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp), covering classical BWS without a molecular diagnosis and BWS-related phenotypes with an 11p15.5 molecular anomaly. Although the consensus group recommends a tumour surveillance programme targeted by molecular subgroups, surveillance might differ according to the local health-care system (for example, in the United States), and the results of targeted and universal surveillance should be evaluated prospectively. International collaboration, including a prospective audit of the results of implementing these consensus recommendations, is required to expand the evidence base for the design of optimum care pathways.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in genes are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation resulting in congenital anomalies, with most patients displaying a neurodevelopmental disorder and dysmorphism. Arboleda-Tham syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in KAT6A (Lysine Acetyltransferase 6A; OMIM 601408) has been recently described as a new neurodevelopmental disorder. Herein, we describe a patient characterized by complex phenotype subsequently diagnosed using the clinical exome sequencing (CES) with Arboleda-Tham syndrome (ARTHS; OMIM 616268). The analysis revealed the presence of de novo pathogenic variant in KAT6A gene, a nucleotide c.3385C>T substitution that introduces a premature termination codon (p.Arg1129*). The need for straight multidisciplinary collaboration and accurate clinical description findings (bowel obstruction/megacolon/intestinal malrotation) was emphasized, together with the utility of CES in establishing an etiological basis in clinical and genetical heterogeneous conditions. Therefore, considering the phenotypic characteristics, the condition's rarity and the reviewed literature, we propose additional diagnostic criteria that could help in the development of future clinical diagnostic guidelines. This was possible thanks to objective examinations performed during the long follow-up period, which permitted scrupulous registration of phenotypic changes over time to further assess this rare disorder. Finally, given that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns used for diagnostic testing and/or as biomarker of disease, a specific episignature for ARTHS has been identified.

AB  - Background: Neonatal 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) exposure to male rats is reported to impair liver function in adulthood. However, the mechanism by which the drug impairs liver function is not well known. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of neonatal exposure of PTU on the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), methyl-DNA binding proteins (MBDs), Gadd45a, p53, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in adult rat liver. Methods: The effects of neonatal transient (from birth to 30 days of age) and persistent (from birth to 90 days of age) treatment of PTU on DNA damage and on the expression of p53, PCNA, DNMTs, and MBDs were investigated at transcriptional and translational levels in male adult liver. Results: Persistent exposure to PTU from birth caused significant downregulation of expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a and upregulation of DNMT3b, MBD4, and Gadd45a without any damage to DNA. Although MeCp2 transcripts were significantly low in the liver of adult rats after persistent exposure to PTU compared to controls, its translated products were significantly higher than in controls. The expression of p53 and PCNA in PTU-treated rats was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that in control rats. Conclusion: The results suggest that neonatal exposure of male rats to PTU resulted in alteration in the expression of proteins that are associated with DNA methylation and genome stabilization in adult rat liver.

AB  - Noonan, Turner, and Prader-Willi syndromes are classical genetic disorders that are marked by short stature. Each disorder has been recognized for several decades and is backed by extensive published literature describing its features, genetic origins, and optimal treatment strategies. These disorders are accompanied by a multitude of comorbidities, including cardiovascular issues, endocrinopathies, and infertility. Diagnostic delays, syndrome-associated comorbidities, and inefficient communication among the members of a patient’s health care team can affect a patient’s well-being from birth through adulthood. Insufficient information is available to help patients and their multidisciplinary team of providers transition from pediatric to adult health care systems. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features and genetics associated with each syndrome, describe best practices for diagnosis and treatment, and emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary teams and appropriate care plans for the pediatric to adult health care transition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals born very low birthweight (VLBW) are at increased risk of impaired cardiovascular and respiratory function in adulthood. To identify markers to predict future risk for VLBW individuals, we analyzed DNA methylation at birth and at 28 years in the New Zealand (NZ) VLBW cohort (all infants born < 1500 g in NZ in 1986) compared with age-matched, normal birthweight controls. Associations between neonatal methylation and cardiac structure and function (echocardiography), vascular function and respiratory outcomes at age 28 years were documented. RESULTS: Genomic DNA from archived newborn heel-prick blood (n = 109 VLBW, 51 controls) and from peripheral blood at ~ 28 years (n = 215 VLBW, 96 controls) was analyzed on Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850 K arrays. Following quality assurance and normalization, methylation levels were compared between VLBW cases and controls at both ages by linear regression, with genome-wide significance set to p < 0.05 adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg). In neonates, methylation at over 16,400 CpG methylation sites differed between VLBW cases and controls and the canonical pathway most enriched for these CpGs was Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling (p = 3.44E-11). The top 20 CpGs that differed most between VLBW cases and controls featured clusters in ARID3A, SPATA33, and PLCH1 and these 3 genes, along with MCF2L, TRBJ2-1 and SRC, led the list of 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) reaching FDR-adj significance. Fifteen of the 20 top CpGs in the neonate EWAS showed associations between methylation at birth and adult cardiovascular traits (particularly LnRHI). In 28-year-old adults, twelve CpGs differed between VLBW cases and controls at FDR-adjusted significance, including hypermethylation in EBF4 (four CpGs), CFI and UNC119B and hypomethylation at three CpGs in HIF3A and one in KCNQ1. DNA methylation GrimAge scores at 28 years were significantly greater in VLBW cases versus controls and weakly associated with cardiovascular traits. Four CpGs were identified where methylation differed between VLBW cases and controls in both neonates and adults, three reversing directions with age (two CpGs in EBF4, one in SNAI1 were hypomethylated in neonates, hypermethylated in adults). Of these, cg16426670 in EBF4 at birth showed associations with several cardiovascular traits in adults. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that methylation patterns in VLBW neonates may be informative about future adult cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and have value in guiding early preventative care to improve adult health.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is associated with changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) and improvements in neonatal neurobehavior. Study design: Buccal swabs were collected from 37 neonates before and after morphine treatment for NAS. Genomic DNA was extracted, and DNAm was examined at 4 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within the OPRM1 gene. Assessment with the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) was also performed before and after NAS treatment. Changes in DNAm (DNAmpost-tx – DNAmpre-tx) and NNNS summary scores (NNNSpost-tx – NNNSpre-tx) were then calculated. Path analysis was used to examine associations among pharmacologic treatment (length of treatment [LOT] and total dose of morphine), changes in DNAm, and changes in NNNS summary scores. Results: DNAm was significantly decreased from pretreatment to post-treatment at 1 of 4 CpG sites within the OPRM1 gene. Neonates also demonstrated decreased excitability, hypertonia, lethargy, signs of stress and abstinence, and increased quality of movement and regulation from pretreatment to post-treatment. Longer LOT and higher morphine dose were associated with greater decreases in DNAm; greater decreases in DNAm were associated with greater decreases in excitability and hypertonia on the NNNS. Conclusions: Pharmacologic treatment of NAS is associated with decreased DNAm of the OPRM1 gene and improved neonatal neurobehavior. Epigenetic changes may play a role in these changes in neonatal neurobehavior.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) in animals and humans predicts obesity and metabolic dysfunction in the offspring. Epigenetic modification of gene function is considered one possible mechanism by which PNMS results in poor outcomes in offspring. Our goal was to determine the role of maternal objective exposure and subjective distress on child BMI and central adiposity at 13½ years of age, and to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation mediates the effect of PNMS on growth. Mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec ice storm. We assessed their objective exposure and subjective distress in June 1998. At age 13½ their children were weighed and measured (n = 66); a subsample provided blood samples for epigenetic studies (n = 31). Objective and subjective PNMS correlated with central adiposity (waist-to-height ratio); only objective PNMS predicted body mass index (BMI). Bootstrapping analyses showed that the methylation level of genes from established Type-1 and -2 diabetes mellitus pathways showed significant mediation of the effect of objective PNMS on both central adiposity and BMI. However, the negative mediating effects indicate that, although greater objective PNMS predicts greater BMI and adiposity, this effect is dampened by the effects of objective PNMS on DNA methylation, suggesting a protective role of the selected genes from Type-1 and -2 diabetes mellitus pathways. We provide data supporting that DNA methylation is a potential mechanism involved in the long-term adaptation and programming of the genome in response to early adverse environmental factors.

MOWS is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, typical facial phenotype and other anomalies, such as short stature, Hirschsprung disease, brain and heart defects. Despite some recognizable features, MOWS rarity and phenotypic variability may complicate its diagnosis, particularly in the neonatal period. In order to define a novel diagnostic biomarker for MOWS, we determined the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of DNA samples from 29 individuals with confirmed clinical and molecular diagnosis. Through multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified and validated a DNA methylation signature involving 296 differentially methylated probes as part of the broader MOWS DNA methylation profile. The prevalence of hypomethylated CpG sites agrees with the main role of ZEB2 as a transcriptional repressor, while differential methylation within the ZEB2 locus supports the previously proposed autoregulation ability. Correlation studies compared the MOWS cohort with 56 previously described DNA methylation profiles of other neurodevelopmental disorders, further validating the specificity of this biomarker. In conclusion, MOWS DNA methylation signature is highly sensitive and reproducible, providing a useful tool to facilitate diagnosis.

AB  - An adequate intake of vitamin B12 during pregnancy plays an important role in offspring neurodevelopment, potentially via epigenetic processes. We used a two-step Mendelian randomization approach to assess whether DNA methylation plays a mediating and causal role in associations between maternal vitamin B12 status and offspring's cognition. Firstly, we estimated the causal effect of maternal vitamin B12 levels on cord blood DNA methylation using the maternal FUT2 genotypes rs492602:A > G and rs1047781:A > T as proxies for circulating vitamin B12 levels in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and we tested the observed associations in a replication cohort. Secondly, we estimated the causal effect of DNA methylation on IQ using the offspring genotype at sites close to the methylated CpG site as a proxy for DNA methylation in ALSPAC and in a replication sample. The first step Mendelian randomization estimated that maternal vitamin B12 had a small causal effect on DNA methylation in offspring at three CpG sites, which was replicated for one of the sites. The second step Mendelian randomization found weak evidence of a causal effect of DNA methylation at two of these sites on childhood performance IQ which was replicated for one of the sites. The findings support a causal effect of maternal vitamin B12 levels on cord blood DNA methylation, and a causal effect of vitamin B12-responsive DNA methylation changes on children's cognition. Some limitations were identified and future studies using a similar approach should aim to overcome such issues. Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Objective: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral syndrome that begins in childhood and affects 3.4% of children worldwide. Due to its etiological complexity, there are no consistent biomarkers for ADHD, however the high heritability presented by the disorder indicates a genetic/epigenetic influence. The main epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, a process with an important role in gene expression and in many psychiatric disorders. Thus, our study sought to identify epi-signatures biomarkers in 29 children clinically diagnosed with ADHD. Methods: After DNA extraction and bisulfite conversion, we performed methylation array experiment for differential methylation, ontological and biological age analysis. Results: The biological response in ADHD patients was not sufficient to determine a conclusive epi-signature in our study. However, our results highlighted the interaction of energy metabolism and oxidative stress pathways in ADHD patients detected by differential methylation patterns. Furthermore, we were able to identify a marginal association between the DNAmAge and ADHD. Conclusion: Our study present new methylation biomarkers findings associated with energy metabolism and oxidative stress pathways, in addition to DNAmAge in ADHD patients. However, we propose that further multiethnic studies, with larger cohorts and including maternal conditions, are necessary to demonstrate a definitive association between ADHD and these methylation biomarkers.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the frequency of pseudoprogression of glioblastoma in Chinese patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy and investigate its association with pseudoprogression and tumour molecular marker O6- methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status. Design Case series with internal comparisons. Setting University teaching hospital, Hong Kong. Patients Patients with glioblastoma treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy during April 2005 to June 2010 were reviewed. Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, preand post-concomitant chemoradiotherapy and 3-monthly thereafter were reviewed by an independent neuroradiologist according to Macdonald's criteria. Relevant patient information (clinical condition, performance score, development of new neurological deficits, use of steroids, and survival) was retrieved. For each patient, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status was investigated with genomic DNA from formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded sections of tumour tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results During the study period, 28 primary glioblastoma patients underwent concomitant chemoradiotherapy. The mean age of the patients was 48 (range, 16-71) years. Thirteen patients (13/28, 46%) developed early radiological progression of the tumour after completion of concomitant chemoradiotherapy, of whom five (39%) were subsequently found to have had pseudoprogression. Patients with pseudoprogression showed a trend towards longer survival (22 months in pseudoprogression vs 17 months in all others vs 11 months in those with genuine progression). Among the 27 patients tested for O6- methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter status, 12 (44%) were methylated. Two (2/12, 17%) in the methylated group had pseudoprogression, while three (3/15, 20%) in the unmethylated group had pseudoprogression. Conclusions Nearly half of all patients (46%) developed early radiological progression (within 3 months of completing concomitant chemoradiotherapy). Moreover, about one in three of such patients had pseudoprogression. Pseudoprogression is an important clinical condition to be aware of to prevent premature termination of an effective treatment.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders. It is reported to be an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival (OS). Our aim was to analyze the role of global DNA methylation using an anti-5-methylcytosine (5-MC) antibody by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of bone marrow biopsy (BM Bx) specimens in MDS patients, assessing correlations with various clinical and biological prognostic factors. Material and methods: A total of 59 MDS cases, classified as per the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 guidelines, were evaluated over a period of 4 years. Clinical data were retrieved from departmental case records and anti-5-MC expression was analyzed with formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections of BM Bx specimens of MDS patients and controls. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 52 years (15-85years). Patients were categorized into low risk (59%) and high risk (41%) according to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The median follow-up time was 10 months (1 to 37 months). We generated a methylation score (M-score) using anti-5-MC and with the derived cut-off of 30.5 from the receiver operator curve (ROC), there was a significant difference between the two groups in the percentage of BM blasts (p=0.01), WHO sub-type (p=0.01), IPSS (p=0.004), progression to AML (p=0.04) on univariate analysis. Interestingly, patients showing a high M-score (M-score ≥ 30.5) demonstrated a significantly shorter OS and progression to AML. However, on multivariate analysis, only BM blasts (p=0.01) and IPSS (p=0.02) remained independent variables for progression to AML and OS respectively. Conclusion: Immunostaining with anti-5-MC antibody with BM Bx samples is a simple and cost effective technique to detect global methylation, a powerful tool to predict overall survival in patients with MDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent childhood disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a replicated environmental risk factor for this disorder. It is also a robust modifier of gene methylation during the prenatal developmental period. In this study, we sought to identify loci differentially methylated by maternal smoking during pregnancy and relate their methylation levels to various behavioural and physical outcomes relevant to ADHD. METHODS: We extracted DNA from blood samples from children diagnosed with ADHD and deeply phenotyped. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was self-declared and assessed retrospectively. RESULTS: Our sample included 231 children with ADHD. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation between children exposed or not to maternal smoking during pregnancy were detected in 3457 CpGs. We kept 30 CpGs with at least 5% of methylation difference between the 2 groups for further analysis. Six genes were associated with varied phenotypes of clinical relevance to ADHD. The levels of DNA methylation in RUNX1 were positively correlated with the CBCL scores, and DNA methylation in MYO1G correlated positively with the score at the Conners rating scale. Methylation level in a CpG located in GFI1 correlated with birthweight, a risk factor for ADHD. Differentially methylated regions were also identified and confirmed the association of RUNX1 methylation levels with the CBCL score. LIMITATIONS: The study has several limitations, including the retrospective recall with self-report of maternal smoking during pregnancy as well as the grouping of individuals of varying age and developmental stage and of both males and females. In addition, the correlation design prevents the building of causation models. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the association between the level of methylation at specific loci and quantitative dimensions highly relevant for ADHD as well as birth weight, a measure that has already been associated with increased risk for ADHD. Our results provide further support to public health educational initiatives to stop maternal smoking during pregnancy. Copyright © 2023 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.

AB  - Recent efforts have focused on developing methylation risk scores (MRS), a weighted sum of the individual's DNA methylation (DNAm) values of pre-selected CpG sites. Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences.

AB  - Background: Clinical parameter-based nomograms and staging systems provide limited information for the prediction of survival in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients. In this study, we developed a methylation signature that precisely predicts overall survival (OS) after surgery. Methods: An epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted for two independent cohorts (discovery cohort, n=164; validation cohort, n=170) from three hepatobiliary centers in China. By referring to differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we proposed the concept of prognostically methylated regions (PMRs), which were composed of consecutive prognostically methylated CpGs (PMCs). Using machine learning strategies (Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selector regression), a prognostic methylation score (PMS) was constructed based on 14 PMRs in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the validation cohort. Results: The C-indices of the PMS for predicting OS in the discovery and validation cohorts were 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. In the whole cohort, the PMS was an independent predictor of OS [hazard ratio (HR) =8.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.48-12.04; P<0.001], and the C-index (0.78) of the PMS was significantly higher than that of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSM) nomogram (0.69, P<0.001), the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHBSH) nomogram (0.67, P<0.001), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system (0.61, P<0.001), and MEGNA prognostic score (0.60, P<0.001). The patients in quartile 4 of PMS could benefit from adjuvant therapy (AT) (HR =0.54; 95% CI: 0.32-0.91; log-rank P=0.043), whereas those in the quartiles 1-3 could not. However, other nomograms and staging system failed to do so. Further analyses of potential mechanisms showed that the PMS was associated with tumor biological behaviors, pathway activation, and immune microenvironment. Conclusions: The PMS could improve the prognostic accuracy and identify patients who would benefit from AT for ICC patients, and might facilitate decisions in treatment of ICC patients.

AB  - Purpose: Gabriele-de Vries syndrome (GADEVS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and distinct facial features. To refine the phenotype and to better understand the molecular basis of the syndrome, we analyzed clinical data and performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a series of individuals carrying a YY1 variant. Methods: Clinical data were collected for 13 individuals not yet reported through an international call for collaboration. DNA was collected for 11 of these individuals and 2 previously reported individuals in an attempt to delineate a specific DNA methylation signature in GADEVS. Results: Phenotype in most individuals overlapped with the previously described features. We described 1 individual with atypical phenotype, heterozygous for a missense variant in a domain usually not involved in individuals with YY1 pathogenic missense variations. We also described a specific peripheral blood DNA methylation profile associated with YY1 variants. Conclusion: We reported a distinct DNA methylation episignature in GADEVS. We expanded the clinical profile of GADEVS to include thin/sparse hair and cryptorchidism. We also highlighted the utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for classification of variants of unknown clinical significance.

AB  - Understanding the biological mechanisms behind multimorbidity patterns in adolescence is important as they may act as intermediary risk factor for long-term health. We aimed to explore relationship between prenatal exposures and adolescent's psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits mediated through epigenetic biomarkers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used data from mother-child dyads from pregnancy and adolescents at 16-17 years from two prospective cohorts: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) and Raine Study from Australia. Factor analysis was applied to generate two different latent factor structures: (a) prenatal exposures and (b) adolescence psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits. Furthermore, three types of epigenetic biomarkers were included: (1) DNA methylation score for maternal smoking during pregnancy (DNAmMSS), (2) DNAm age estimate PhenoAge and (3) DNAm estimate for telomere length (DNAmTL). Similar factor structure was observed between both cohorts yielding three prenatal factors, namely BMI (Body Mass Index), SOP (Socio-Obstetric-Profile), and Lifestyle, and four adolescent factors: Anthropometric, Insulin-Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, and Mental health. In the SEM pathways, stronger direct effects of F1prenatal-BMI (NFBC1986 = beta: 0.27; Raine = beta: 0.39) and F2prenatal-SOP (beta: -0.11) factors were observed on adolescent psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We observed an indirect effect of prenatal latent factors through epigenetic markers on a psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity factor in Raine study (P < 0.05). The present study exemplifies an evidence-based approach in two different birth cohorts to demonstrate similar composite structure of prenatal exposures and psycho-cardiometabolic traits (despite cultural, social, and genetic differences) and a common plausible pathway between them through underlying epigenetic markers.

AB  - Au-Kline syndrome (AKS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with multiple malformations and a characteristic facial gestalt. The first individuals ascertained carried de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in HNRNPK. Here, we report 32 individuals with AKS (26 previously unpublished), including 13 with de novo missense variants. We propose new clinical diagnostic criteria for AKS that differentiate it from the clinically overlapping Kabuki syndrome and describe a significant phenotypic expansion to include individuals with missense variants who present with subtle facial features and few or no malformations. Many gene-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures have been identified for neurodevelopmental syndromes. Because HNRNPK has roles in chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hypothesized that pathogenic variants in HNRNPK may be associated with a specific DNAm signature. Here, we report a unique DNAm signature for AKS due to LoF HNRNPK variants, distinct from controls and Kabuki syndrome. This DNAm signature is also identified in some individuals with de novo HNRNPK missense variants, confirming their pathogenicity and the phenotypic expansion of AKS to include more subtle phenotypes. Furthermore, we report that some individuals with missense variants have an “intermediate” DNAm signature that parallels their milder clinical presentation, suggesting the presence of an epi-genotype phenotype correlation. In summary, the AKS DNAm signature may help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of AKS. This DNAm signature also effectively supported clinical syndrome delineation and is a valuable aid for variant interpretation in individuals where a clinical diagnosis of AKS is unclear, particularly for mild presentations.

AB  - The coexistence of 2 genetic diseases can mutually modify their course. We describe the case of a 10-year-old boy with Sliver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The patient's short stature, which is part of the clinical picture of both diseases, has been additionally aggravated by the steroid therapy, which is necessary to delay the progression of DMD. From the age of 9 years, the patient was treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for 18 months. The following study discusses whether rhGH therapy in a child with SRS and DMD may alleviate or worsen the course of DMD, and how it affects carbohydrate metabolism disorders.

AB  - Background : We previously associated HIST1H1E mutations causing Rahman syndrome with a specific genome-wide methylation pattern. Results: Methylome analysis from peripheral blood samples of six affected subjects led us to identify a specific hypomethylated profile. This "episignature" was enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A computational classifier yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting subjects with Rahman syndrome. Applying this model to a cohort of undiagnosed probands allowed us to reach diagnosis in one subject. Conclusions: We demonstrate an epigenetic signature in subjects with Rahman syndrome that can be used to reach molecular diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements and/or postures. Heterozygous variants in lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), encoding a histone H3 methyltransferase, have been associated with a childhood-onset, progressive and complex form of dystonia (dystonia 28, DYT28). Since 2016, more than one hundred rare KMT2B variants have been reported, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense and other in-frame changes, many having an uncertain clinical impact. RESULTS: We characterize the genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of a cohort of 18 patients with pathogenic and unclassified KMT2B variants. We resolve the "episignature" associated with KMT2B haploinsufficiency, proving that this approach is robust in diagnosing clinically unsolved cases, properly classifying them with respect to other partially overlapping dystonic phenotypes, other rare neurodevelopmental disorders and healthy controls. Notably, defective KMT2B function in DYT28 causes a non-random DNA hypermethylation across the genome, selectively involving promoters and other regulatory regions positively controlling gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinctive DNA hypermethylation pattern associated with DYT28, provide an epigenetic signature for this disorder enabling accurate diagnosis and reclassification of ambiguous genetic findings and suggest potential therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Social determinants of health (SDoH) are defined as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. The distribution of these conditions is influenced by underlying structural factors and may be linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes through epigenetic modifications of gestational tissues. A promising modification is epigenetic gestational age (eGA), which captures ‘biological’ age at birth. Measuring eGA in placenta, an organ critical for foetal development, may provide information about how SDoH ‘get under the skin’ during pregnancy to influence birth outcomes and ethnic/racial disparities. We examined relationships of placental eGA with sociodemographic factors, smoking, and two key clinical outcomes: Apgar scores and NICU length of stay. Using the Robust Placental Clock, we estimated eGA for placental samples from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns cohort (N = 408). Regression modelling revealed smoking during pregnancy was associated with placental eGA acceleration (i.e., eGA higher than chronologic gestational age). This association differed by maternal race: among infants born to mothers racialized as Black, we observed greater eGA acceleration (+0.89 week, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.40) as compared to those racialized as white (+0.27 week, 95% CI: −0.06, 0.59). Placental eGA acceleration was also correlated with shorter NICU lengths of stay, but only among infants born to mothers racialized as Black (−0.08 d/week-eGA, 95% CI: −0.12, −0.05). Together, these observed associations suggest that interpretations of epigenetic gestational aging may be tissue-specific.

AB  - The mechanism of profound generalized iduronate sulfatase (IDS) deficiency in a developmentally delayed female with clinical Hunter syndrome was studied. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the patient, using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27β, showed that the paternal allele was resistant to HpaII digestion (i.e., was methylated) while the maternal allele was digested (i.e., was hypomethylated), indicating marked imbalance of X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient. Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the DXS255 locus (M27β), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome, and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.

AB  - The early environment, acting via epigenetic processes, is associated with differential risk of cardiometabolic disease (CMD), which can be predicted by epigenetic marks in proxy tissues. However, such measurements at time points disparate from the health outcome or the environmental exposure may be confounded by intervening stochastic and environmental variation. To address this, we analyzed DNA methylation in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha promoter in blood from 40 children (20 boys) collected annually between 5 and 14 years of age by pyrosequencing. Body composition was measured annually by dual X-ray absorptiometry, physical activity by accelerometry, and pubertal timing by age at peak high velocity. The effect of methylation on transcription factor binding was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Seven cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) loci were identified that showed no significant temporal change or association with leukocyte populations. Modeling using generalized estimating equations showed that methylation of four loci predicted adiposity up to 14 years independent of sex, age, pubertal timing, and activity. Methylation of one predictive locus modified binding of the proadipogenic pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1/homeobox 9 complex. These findings suggest that temporally stable CpG loci measured in childhood may have utility in predicting CMD risk. Copyright © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Purpose: Witteveen-Kolk syndrome (WITKOS) is a rare, autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous loss-of-function alterations in the SIN3A gene. WITKOS has variable expressivity that commonly overlaps with other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we characterized a distinct DNA methylation epigenetic signature (episignature) distinguishing WITKOS from unaffected individuals as well as individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders with episignatures and described 9 previously unpublished individuals with SIN3A haploinsufficiency. Methods: We studied the phenotypic characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the identification of the episignature and building of a predictive diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples. Results: A predominantly hypomethylated DNA methylation profile specific to WITKOS was identified, and the classifier model was able to diagnose a previously unresolved test case. The episignature was sensitive enough to detect individuals with varying degrees of phenotypic severity carrying SIN3A haploinsufficient variants. Conclusion: We identified a novel, robust episignature in WITKOS due to SIN3A haploinsufficiency. This episignature has the potential to aid identification and diagnosis of individuals with WITKOS.

AB  - Purpose: Patients with rare or ultra-rare genetic diseases, which affect 350 million people worldwide, may experience a diagnostic odyssey. High-throughput sequencing leads to an etiological diagnosis in up to 50% of individuals with heterogeneous neurodevelopmental or malformation disorders. There is a growing interest in additional omics technologies in translational research settings to examine the remaining unsolved cases. Methods: We gathered 30 individuals with malformation syndromes and/or severe neurodevelopmental disorders with negative trio exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization results through a multicenter project. We applied short-read genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation analysis, in that order, as complementary translational research tools for a molecular diagnosis. Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood. Conclusion: Overall, our integrated genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylation analysis solved 10/30 (33.3%) cases and identified a strong candidate gene in 4/30 (13.3%) of the patients with rare neurodevelopmental disorders and negative exome sequencing results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is closely associated with a phenotype that includes brain dysmaturation and neurocognitive impairment, commonly termed Encephalopathy of Prematurity (EoP), of which systemic inflammation is considered a key driver. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00 to 4.71 , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 0.218 ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 0.371 ), independent of other confounding exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Exposure to maternal mood disorder in utero may program infant neurobehavior via DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD-2), two placental genes that have been implicated in perturbations of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis. We tested the relations among prenatal exposure to maternal depression or anxiety, methylation of exon 1F of NR3C1 and 11β-HSD-2, and newborn neurobehavior. Controlling for relevant covariates, infants whose mothers reported depression during pregnancy and showed greater methylation of placental NR3C1 CpG2 had poorer self-regulation, more hypotonia, and more lethargy than infants whose mothers did not report depression. On the other hand, infants whose mothers reported anxiety during pregnancy and showed greater methylation of placental 11β-HSD-2 CpG4 were more hypotonic compared with infants of mothers who did not report anxiety during pregnancy. Our results support the fetal programming hypothesis and suggest that fetal adjustments to cues from the intrauterine environment, in this case an environment that could be characterized by increased exposure to maternal cortisol, may lead to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is of public health concern, and understanding the biological mechanisms can help to promote smoking cessation campaigns. This non-systematic review focuses on the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring's epigenome, consistent in chemical modifications of the genome that regulate gene expression. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy is consistently associated with offspring's DNA methylation changes, both in the placenta and blood. These studies indicate that effects on blood DNA methylation can persist for years, and that the longer the duration of the exposure and the higher the dose, the larger the effects. Hence, DNA methylation scores have been developed to estimate past exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy as biomarkers. There is robust evidence for DNA methylation alterations associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy; however, the role of sex, ethnicity, and genetic background needs further exploration. Moreover, there are no conclusive studies about exposure to low doses or during the preconception period. Similarly, studies on tissues other than the placenta and blood are scarce, and cell-type specificity within tissues needs further investigation. In addition, biological interpretation of DNA methylation findings requires multi-omics data, poorly available in epidemiological settings. Finally, although several mediation analyses link DNA methylation changes with health outcomes, they do not allow causal inference. For this, a combination of data from multiple study designs will be essential in the future to better address this topic. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - KDM5C encodes a demethylase of the histone H3 lysine 4 residue, involved in chromatin regulation and gene expression. Hemizygous KDM5C pathogenic variants cause X-linked intellectual disability of Claes-Jensen type. Because of its mode of inheritance and the low specificity of the clinical phenotype, interpretation of variants can be difficult, hence the need for functional studies and biomarkers specific to this disorder. We present the case of a male patient with intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities and subtle dysmorphic features, in which genetic investigation identified a hemizygous novel missense KDM5C variant of uncertain significance (VUS), inherited from his asymptomatic mother and present in his paucisymptomatic sister. We assessed the global genomic DNA methylation status from a whole blood sample of the proband. Global DNA methylation profiling specifically identified the recently discovered epi-signature of Claes-Jensen syndrome. This result served as a biomarker which independently highlighted KDM5C as the cause of the disorder in this patient. Because of the X-linked mode of inheritance, variant reclassification had a high impact on genetic counseling in this family. This example highlights the value of global methylome profiling in situations of variants of uncertain significance in genes with a known specific epi-signature.

AB  - The cumulative effects of proximal family risk factors have been associated with a high number of adverse outcomes in childhood maltreatment, and DNA methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been associated with child maltreatment. However, the relationships between proximal family risk factors and SLC6A4 methylation remains unexplored. We examined the association among cumulative family risk factors, maltreatment experiences and DNA methylation in the SLC6A4 gene in a sample of 33 child victims of maltreatment. We computed a cumulative family risk (CFR) index that included proximal family risk factors, such as drug or alcohol abuse, psychopathology, parents’ experiences of maltreatment/abuse in childhood, criminal history, and domestic violence. The majority of children (90.9%) experienced more than one type of maltreatment. Hierarchical regression models suggested that the higher the CFR index score and the number of maltreatment experiences, and the older the children, the higher the SLC6A4 DNA methylation levels. Although preliminary, our findings suggest that, along with childhood maltreatment experiences per se, cumulative proximal family risk factors are seemingly critically associated with DNA methylation at the SLC6A4 gene.

AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is diagnosed using the histopathological Weiss score (WS), but remains clinically elusive unless it has metastasized or grows locally invasive. Previously, we proposed the objective IGF2 methylation score as diagnostic tool for ACC. This multicenter European cohort study validates these findings. Patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from adrenocortical tumor patients. DNA was isolated from frozen specimens, where after DMR2, CTCF3, and H19 were pyrosequenced. The predictive value of the methylation score for malignancy, defined by the WS or metastasis development, was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic and Cox regression analyses. Seventy-six ACC patients and 118 patients with adrenocortical adenomas were included from seven centers. The methylation score and tumor size were independently associated with the pathological ACC diagnosis (OR 3.756 95% CI 2.224-6.343; OR 1.467 95% CI 1.202-1.792, respectively; Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.903), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.957 (95% CI 0.930-0.984). The methylation score alone resulted in an AUC of 0.910 (95% CI 0.866-0.952). Cox regression analysis revealed that the methylation score, WS and tumor size predicted development of metastases in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only the WS predicted development of metastasis (OR 1.682 95% CI 1.285-2.202; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we validated the high diagnostic accuracy of the IGF2 methylation score for diagnosing ACC in a multicenter European cohort study. Considering the known limitations of the WS, the objective IGF2 methylation score could potentially provide extra guidance on decisions on postoperative strategies in adrenocortical tumor patients.

AB  - Mutations in ADNP result in Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. Here, we describe the first de novo intronic deletion, affecting the splice-acceptor site of the first coding ADNP exon in a five-year-old girl with developmental delay and autism. Whereas exome sequencing failed to detect the non-coding deletion, genome-wide CpG methylation analysis revealed an episignature suggestive of a Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome diagnosis. This diagnosis was further supported by PhenoScore, a novel facial recognition software package. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing resolved the three-base pair ADNP deletion c.[-5-1_-4del] with transcriptome sequencing showing this deletion leads to skipping of exon 4. An N-terminal truncated protein could not be detected in transfection experiments with a mutant expression vector in HEK293T cells, strongly suggesting this is a first confirmed diagnosis exclusively due to haploinsufficiency of the ADNP gene. Pathway analysis of the methylome indicated differentially methylated genes involved in brain development, the cytoskeleton, locomotion, behavior, and muscle development. Along the same line, transcriptome analysis identified most of the differentially expressed genes as upregulated, in line with the hypomethylated CpG episignature and confirmed the involvement of the cytoskeleton and muscle development pathways that are also affected in patient cell lines and animal models. In conclusion, this novel mutation for the first time demonstrates that Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome can be caused by a loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, our study elegantly illustrates the use of EpiSignatures, WGS and Phenoscore as novel complementary diagnostic tools in case a of negative WES result. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Variations in serotoninergic signaling have been related to behavioral outcomes. Alterations in the genome, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, are affected by serotonin neurotransmission. The amygdala is an important brain region involved in emotional responses and impulsivity, which receives serotoninergic input. In addition, studies suggest that the serotonin transporter gene network may interact with the environment and influence the risk for psychiatric disorders. We propose to investigate whether/how interactions between the exposure to early life adversity and serotonin transporter gene network in the amygdala associate with behavioral disorders. We constructed a co-expression-based polygenic risk score (ePRS) reflecting variations in the function of the serotonin transporter gene network in the amygdala and investigated its interaction with postnatal adversity on attention problems in two independent cohorts from Canada and Singapore. We also described how interactions between ePRS-5-HTT and postnatal adversity exposure predict brain gray matter density and variation in DNA methylation across the genome. We observed that the expression-based polygenic risk score, reflecting the function of the amygdala 5-HTT gene network, interacts with postnatal adversity, to predict attention and hyperactivity problems across both cohorts. Also, both postnatal adversity score and amygdala ePRS-5-HTT score, as well as their interaction, were observed to be associated with variation in DNA methylation across the genome. Variations in gray matter density in brain regions linked to attentional processes were also correlated to our ePRS score. These results confirm that the amygdala 5-HTT gene network is strongly associated with ADHD-related behaviors, brain cortical density, and epigenetic changes in the context of adversity in young children.

AB  - Accurate assessment of neuroblastoma outcome prediction remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims at establishing novel prognostic tumor DNA methylation biomarkers. In total, 396 low- and high-risk primary tumors were analyzed, of which 87 were profiled using methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing for differential methylation analysis between prognostic patient groups. Subsequently, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were developed for 78 top-ranking differentially methylated regions and tested on two independent cohorts of 132 and 177 samples, respectively. Further, a new statistical framework was used to identify a robust set of MSP assays of which the methylation score (i.e. the percentage of methylated assays) allows accurate outcome prediction. Survival analyses were performed on the individual target level, as well as on the combined multimarker signature. As a result of the differential DNA methylation assessment by MBD sequencing, 58 of the 78 MSP assays were designed in regions previously unexplored in neuroblastoma, and 36 are located in non-promoter or non-coding regions. In total, 5 individual MSP assays (located in CCDC177, NXPH1, lnc-MRPL3-2, lnc-TREX1-1 and one on a region from chromosome 8 with no further annotation) predict event-free survival and 4 additional assays (located in SPRED3, TNFAIP2, NPM2 and CYYR1) also predict overall survival. Furthermore, a robust 58-marker methylation signature predicting overall and event-free survival was established. In conclusion, this study encompasses the largest DNA methylation biomarker study in neuroblastoma so far. We identified and independently validated several novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as a prognostic 58-marker methylation signature.

AB  - Background:. Maternal smoking has been linked to adverse health outcomes in newborns but the extent to which it impacts newborn health has not been quantified through an aggregated cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) score. Here, we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. Methods:. We first examined the association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, and smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n=744). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n=347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent White European (n=397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n=504). Results:. Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent association signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p<5 × 10-5). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR = 1.09 [1.07, 1.10], p=5.5 × 10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8 × 10-9) in White Europeans. However, it was not associated with self-reported exposure (p>0.05) among South Asians, likely due to a lack of smoking in this group. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (–0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (–0.043±0.013 kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts. Conclusions:. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birth weight in newborns, in both White European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers. Funding:. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Metabolomics Team Grant: MWG-146332.

AB  - Background and Objectives. Methylation profile scores (MPSs) index biological aging and aging-related disease in adults and are cross-sectionally associated with social determinants of health in childhood. MPSs thus provide an opportunity to trace how aging-related biology responds to environmental changes in early life. Information regarding the stability of MPSs in early life is currently lacking. Method. We use longitudinal data from children and adolescents ages 8-18 (N = 428, M age = 12.15 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Participants contributed two waves of salivary DNA-methylation data (mean lag = 3.94 years), which were used to construct four MPSs reflecting multi-system physiological decline and mortality risk (PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel), pace of biological aging (DunedinPACE), and cognitive function (Epigenetic-g). Furthermore, we exploit variation among participants in whether they were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic during the course of study participation, in order to test how a historical period characterized by environmental disruption might affect children’s aging-related MPSs. Results. All MPSs showed moderate longitudinal stability (test-retest rs = 0.42, 0.44, 0.46, 0.51 for PhenoAgeAccel, GrimAgeAccel, and Epigenetic-g, and DunedinPACE, respectively). No differences in the stability of MPSs were apparent between those whose second assessment took place after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic vs. those for whom both assessments took place prior to the pandemic. Conclusions. Aging-related DNA-methylation patterns are less stable in childhood than has been previously observed in adulthood. Further developmental research on the methylome is necessary to understand which environmental perturbations in childhood impact trajectories of biological aging and when children are most sensitive to those impacts.

AB  - PURPOSE: Genome sequencing (GS)-specific diagnostic rates in prospective tightly ascertained exome sequencing (ES)-negative intellectual disability (ID) cohorts have not been reported extensively. METHODS: ES, GS, epigenetic signatures, and long-read sequencing diagnoses were assessed in 74 trios with at least moderate ID. RESULTS: The ES diagnostic yield was 42 of 74 (57%). GS diagnoses were made in 9 of 32 (28%) ES-unresolved families. Repeated ES with a contemporary pipeline on the GS-diagnosed families identified 8 of 9 single-nucleotide variations/copy-number variations undetected in older ES, confirming a GS-unique diagnostic rate of 1 in 32 (3%). Episignatures contributed diagnostic information in 9% with GS corroboration in 1 of 32 (3%) and diagnostic clues in 2 of 32 (6%). A genetic etiology for ID was detected in 51 of 74 (69%) families. Twelve candidate disease genes were identified. Contemporary ES followed by GS cost US$4976 (95% CI: $3704; $6969) per diagnosis and first-line GS at a cost of $7062 (95% CI: $6210; $8475) per diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Performing GS only in ID trios would be cost equivalent to ES if GS were available at $2435, about a 60% reduction from current prices. This study demonstrates that first-line GS achieves higher diagnostic rate than contemporary ES but at a higher cost. Copyright © 2024 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association of the DNA methylation of DAT1 and DRD4 gene with methylphenidate (MPH) response in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: One hundred and eleven DSM-IV defined ADHD Chinese Han children were recruited. Inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity and oppositional symptoms were evaluated by the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham–IV–parent rating scale (SNAP-IV-P) at baseline and 6 weeks after MPH treatment. DNA methylation of CpG sites in the promoter sequences of DAT1 and DRD4 was examined for association with treatment response. Results: Greater improvement on the SNAP-IV-P total score and percentage change from baseline score were both significantly correlated with DAT1 methylation (rho =−0.222, P =.019 and rho = −0.203, P =.032, respectively). A secondary analysis demonstrated that the effect of DAT1 methylation on symptom response was primarily related to the percentage change in oppositional symptoms (rho = −0.242; P =.012), with a smaller significant effect on hyperactivity–impulsivity (rho = −0.192; P =.045). No significant correlation was found between the treatment effect on inattention and DAT1 methylation (rho = −0.101; P =.292). No significant correlation was observed between mean DRD4 methylation and measures of treatment outcome or baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings provide initial evidence for the involvement of the epigenetic alterations of DAT1 in modulating the response to MPH treatment in ADHD, primarily on oppositional and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.

AB  - CHD8, a major autism gene, functions in chromatin remodelling and has various roles involving several biological pathways. Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype–phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26–28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution poses a global environmental challenge with significant concerns regarding its potential impact on human health. Toxicological investigations have revealed multi-system impairments caused by MPs in various organisms. However, the specific reproductive hazards in human contexts remain elusive, and understanding the transgenerational reproductive toxicity of MPs remains limited. This study delves into the reproductive toxicity resulting from lactational exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) in female mice, extending the inquiry to assess the reproductive effects on their offspring bred by rigorous natural mating. The MPs dosage corresponds to the detected concentration in infant formula prepared using plastic bottles. By systematically evaluating the reproductive phenotypes of F0 female mice from birth to adulthood, we found that female mice exposed to PS-MPs exhibited delayed puberty, disturbed estrous cyclicity, diminished fertility, elevated testosterone, abnormal follicle development, disrupted ovarian steroidogenesis, and ovarian inflammation. Importantly, the observed inheritable reproductive toxicity manifested with gender specificity, showcasing more pronounced abnormalities in male offspring. Specifically, reproductive disorders did not manifest in female offspring; however, a significant decrease in sperm count and viability was observed in PS-MPs-exposed F1 males. Testicular transcriptomics analysis of F1 males significantly enriched pathways associated with reproductive system development and epigenetic modification, such as male germ cell proliferation, DNA methylation, and histone modification. In summary, real-life exposure to PS-MPs impaired the reproductive function of female mice and threateningly disrupted the spermatogenesis of their F1 male offspring, which raises serious concerns about inter- and trans-generational reproductive toxicities of MPs in mammals. These findings underscore the potential threats of MPs to human reproductive health, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and research in this critical area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to maternal smoking is detrimental to child health but its association with risk of cancer has seldom been investigated. Maternal smoking induces widespread and long-lasting DNA methylation changes, which we study here for association with risk of cancer in adulthood. METHODS: Eight prospective case-control studies nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study were used to assess associations between maternal-smoking-associated methylation marks in blood and risk of several cancers: breast (n = 406 cases), colorectal (n = 814), gastric (n = 166), kidney (n = 139), lung (n = 327), prostate (n = 847) and urothelial (n = 404) cancer and B-cell lymphoma (n = 426). We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between cancer and five methylation scores calculated as weighted averages for 568, 19, 15, 28 and 17 CpG sites. Models were adjusted for confounders, including personal smoking history (smoking status, pack-years, age at starting and quitting) and methylation scores for personal smoking. RESULTS: All methylation scores for maternal smoking were strongly positively associated with risk of urothelial cancer. Risk estimates were only slightly attenuated after adjustment for smoking history, other potential confounders and methylation scores for personal smoking. Potential negative associations were observed with risk of lung cancer and B-cell lymphoma. No associations were observed for other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We found that methylation marks of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking are associated with increased risk of urothelial cancer. Our study demonstrates the potential for using DNA methylation to investigate the impact of early-life, unmeasured exposures on later-life cancer risk.

AB  - Background: Genetics explains a small proportion of variance in body mass index at the population level. Epigenetics, commonly measured by gene methylation, holds promise for understanding obesity risk factors and mechanisms. Methods: Participants were 431 adolescents aged 10-15 years. BMI z-score, waist circumference z-score, and percent body fat were measured. Saliva samples were collected and methylation of promoter regions of four candidate genes or sequences (LEP, ICAM-1, CRH, and LINE-1) were measured in 3-4 CpG sites each. Linear regression was used to identify associations of methylation with obesity-related outcomes. Results: After adjusting for age, in sex-stratified analysis, the three obesity-related outcomes were negatively associated with LEP methylation in obese boys only. There were no associations of methylation of the other genes or sequences and the obesity-related outcomes. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with prior studies that reported sex differences in associations of obesity-related outcomes with LEP methylation, and also as would be expected in adipose tissue, the source of circulating leptin. The findings suggest that saliva might be an acceptable tissue for epigenetics studies in adolescents.

AB  - Inflammation is implicated in depression and psychosis, including association of childhood inflammatory markers on the subsequent risk of developing symptoms. However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N = up-to 6401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; beta = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020-0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

AB  - Aims: To identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) across the epigenome and symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a population of Hispanic children. Materials & methods: Among 517 participants in the ELEMENT study aged 9-18 years, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study examining associations between blood leukocyte DNAm and performance on the Conners' continuous performance test (CPT3). Results: DNAm at loci in or near ZNF814, ELF4 and OR6K6 and functional enrichment for gene pathways pertaining to ferroptosis, inflammation, immune response and neurotransmission were significantly related to CPT3 scores. Conclusion: DNAm was associated with CPT3 performance. Further analysis is warranted to understand how these genes and enriched pathways contribute to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

AB  - Background: Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a significant health challenge, especially for children, owing to its chronic autoimmune nature. Although the exact etiology of T1DM remains elusive, the interplay of genetic predisposition, immune responses, and environmental factors are postulated. Genetic factors control immune reactivity against β-cells. Given the pivotal roles of CIITA and CLEC2D genes in modulating a variety of immune pathologies, we hypothesized that genetic variations in CIITA and CLEC2D genes may impact T1DM disease predisposition. This study was designed to explore the association between gene polymorphisms in CIITA (rs8048002) and CLEC2D (rs2114870) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM), with a focus on analyzing the functional consequence of those gene variants. Methods: The study enlisted 178 healthy controls and 148 individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) from Suez Canal University Hospital. Genotyping for CIITA and CLEC2D was done using allelic-discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid profiles were determined through automated analyzer, while fasting blood glucose and insulin serum levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. RegulomeDB was used to examine the regulatory functions of CIITA (rs8048002) and CLEC2D (rs2114870) gene variants. Results: Analysis of the genotype distribution of the CIITA rs8048002 polymorphism revealed a significantly higher prevalence of the rare C allele in T1DM patients compared to the control group (OR = 1.77; P = 0.001). Both the CIITA rs8048002 heterozygote TC genotype (OR = 1.93; P = 0.005) and the rare homozygote CC genotype (OR = 3.62; P = 0.006) were significantly more frequent in children with T1DM when compared to the control group. Conversely, the rare A allele of CLEC2D rs2114870 was found to be significantly less frequent in T1DM children relative to the control group (OR = 0.58; P = 0.002). The heterozygote GA genotype (OR = 0.61; P = 0.033) and the rare homozygote AA genotype (OR = 0.25; P = 0.004) were also significantly less frequent in T1DM patients compared to the control group. Both CIITA (rs8048002) and CLEC2D (rs2114870) gene variants were predicted to have regulatory functions, indicated by a RegulomeDB score of (1f) for each. Conclusion: The rare C allele of CIITA rs8048002 genetic variant was associated with an increased risk of developing T1DM, while the less common A allele of CLEC2D rs2114870 was associated with a reduced risk of T1DM.

AB  - DNA methylation analysis may improve risk stratification in cervical screening. We used a pan-epigenomic approach to identify new methylation markers along the continuum of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer. Physician-collected samples (54 normal, 50 CIN1, 40 CIN2 and 42 CIN3) were randomly selected from women at a single-center colposcopy clinic. Extracted DNA was subjected to Illumina Infinium EPIC array analysis, and methylation was assessed blinded to histopathological and clinical data. CpG sites whose state of methylation correlated with lesion grade were assessed (Spearman correlation), and a weighted methylation score was calculated comparing normal to CIN3. Validation of the top selected genes was performed in an independent cohort (100 normal, 50 CIN1, 50 CIN2, 50 CIN3 and 8 cervical cancers) of new patients, referred for colposcopic examination at three hospitals, using targeted DNA methylation Illumina amplicon sequencing. The relationship between a combined weighted marker score and progression from normal through precancerous lesions and cervical cancer was compared using one-way ANOVA. Our analyses revealed 7,715 CpGs whose methylation level correlated with progression (from normal to CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3), with a significant trend of increased methylation with lesion grade. We shortlisted a bigenic (hyaluronan synthase 1, HAS1 and ATPase phospholipid transporting 10A, ATP10A corresponding to cg03419058 and cg13944175 sites) marker set; r = 0.55, p < 0.0001. Validation of the four most discriminating genes (CA10, DPP10, FMN2 and HAS1) showed a significant correlation between methylation levels and disease progression (p-value < 2.2 × 10−16, adjusted R2 = 0.952). Translational research of the identified genes to future clinical applications is warranted.

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that prenatal chemical exposure triggers epigenetic modifications that could influence health outcomes later in life. In this study, we investigated whether DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (GRIN2B) gene underlies the association between prenatal exposure to an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), bisphenol F (BPF), and lower cognitive functions in 7-year-old children. Methods: Data from 799 children participating in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal Mother and child Asthma and allergy (SELMA) pregnancy cohort was analyzed. Prenatal BPF exposure was assessed by measuring BPF levels in maternal urine. At age 7, DNAm of three CpG sites in a regulatory region of the GRIN2B gene was analyzed from buccal swabs using bisulfite-Pyrosequencing. Cognitive functions, including full-scale IQ and four subscales, were evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV). Associations between prenatal BPF exposure and GRIN2B DNAm, as well as between GRIN2B DNAm and cognitive functions, were determined using regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Generalized structural equation models (gSEM) were used to evaluate if GRIN2B DNAm mediates the association between prenatal BPF exposure and cognitive functions at 7 years of age. Results: Prenatal BPF exposure was positively associated with GRIN2B DNAm levels at the third CpG site (CpG3), while CpG3 methylation was inversely associated with cognitive test scores. Mediation analyses showed that CpG3 methylation exerted 6–9% of the association between BPF exposure and full-scale IQ, as well as verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning in boys, while not significant in girls. Conclusions: This study is the first to identify locus-specific DNAm as a mediating factor underlying an epidemiological association between prenatal EDC exposure and cognitive functions in childhood. It also confirms previous findings, that GRIN2B DNAm is responsive to environmental exposures.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the etiological agent of Johne’s disease (JD) in ruminants, establishes a prolonged and often lifelong enteric infection. The implementation of control measures for bovine JD has faced obstacles due to the considerable expenses involved in disease surveillance and hindered by unreliable and inadequate diagnostic tests, emphasizing the need for an effective vaccine that can stimulate mucosal immunity in the gastrointestinal tract. Previous investigations have demonstrated that deletion of the BacA gene in MAP produces an attenuated strain that can transiently colonize the calf small intestine while retaining its capacity to stimulate systemic immune responses similar to wildtype MAP strains. This study assessed the efficacy of the BacA gene deletion MAP strain, referred to as the BacA vaccine, when administered orally to young calves. The research aimed to evaluate its effectiveness in controlling MAP intestinal infection and to investigate the immune responses elicited by mucosal vaccination. The study represents the first evaluation of an enteric modified live MAP vaccine in the context of an oral MAP challenge in young calves. Oral immunization with BacA reduced MAP colonization specifically in the ileum and ileocecal valve. This partially protective immune response was associated with an increased frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a pro-inflammatory phenotype (IFNγ+/TNFα+) in vaccinated animals. Moreover, re-stimulated PBMCs from vaccinated animals showed increased expression of IFNγ, IP-10, IL-2, and IL-17 at 10- and 12-weeks post challenge. Furthermore, immunophenotyping of blood leukocytes revealed that vaccinated calves had increased levels of T cells expressing cell-surface markers consistent with long-term central memory. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the development and immunogenicity of a modified live MAP vaccine against bovine JD, demonstrating oral vaccination can stimulate host immune responses that can be protective against enteric MAP infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiological maternal stress response, such as imbalance in the glucocorticoid pathway and immune system seems to be mediated by DNA methylation (DNAm) and might translate intrauterine stress exposures into phenotypic changes in a sex-specific manner. DNAm in specific sites can also predict newborn gestational age and gestational age acceleration (GAA). GAA occurs when the predicted biological age is higher than the chronological age. In adults, poor health outcomes related to this deviance are well documented and raise questions for the interpretation and prediction in early stages of life. Boys seem to be more vulnerable to intrauterine stress exposure than girls; however, the mechanisms of adaptive sex-specific responses are still unclear. We hypothesize that intrauterine stress exposure is associated with GAA and could be different in boys and girls if inflammatory or glucocorticoid pathways exposure is considered. RESULTS: Using the Western Region Birth Cohort (ROC-Sao Paulo, Brazil) (n = 83), we calculated DNAm age and GAA from cord blood samples. Two epigenetic risk scores were calculated as an indirect proxy for low-grade inflammation (i-ePGS) and for glucocorticoid exposure (GES). Multivariate linear regression models were applied to investigate associations of GAA with prenatal exposures. The i-ePGS and GES were included in different models with the same co-variates considering sex interactions. The first multivariate model investigating inflammatory exposure (adj. R2 = 0.31, p = < 0.001) showed that GAA was positively associated with i-ePGS (CI, 0.26-113.87, p = 0.049) and negative pregnancy-related feelings (CI, 0.04-0.48 p = 0.019). No sex interaction was observed. The second model investigating glucocorticoid exposure (adj. R2 = 0.32, p = < 0.001) showed that the higher was the GAA was associated with a lower the lower was the GES in girls (CI, 0.04-2.55, p = 0.044). In both models, maternal self-reported mental disorder was negatively associated with GAA. CONCLUSION: Prenatal epigenetic score of exposure to low-grade inflammatory was a predictor of GAA for both sexes. Glucocorticoid epigenetic score seems to be more important to GAA in girls. This study supports the evidence of sex-specificity in stress response, suggesting the glucocorticoid as a possible pathway adopted by girls to accelerate the maturation in an adverse condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that can accumulate in the placenta during pregnancy, where it may impair placental function and affect fetal development. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate Cd-associated variations in placental DNA methylation (DNAM) and associations with gene expression; we also aimed to identify novel pathways involved in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. METHODS: Using placental DNAM and Cd concentrations in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS, n = 343) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS, n = 141), we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between Cd and DNAM, adjusting for tissue heterogeneity using a reference-free method. Cohort-specific results were aggregated via inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis, and variably methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and tests for associations between gene expression and birth size metrics. RESULTS: We identified 17 Cd-associated differentially methylated CpG sites with meta-analysis p-values <1 × 10−5, two of which were within a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). DNAM levels at 9 of the 17 loci were associated with increased expression of 6 genes (5% FDR): TNFAIP2, EXOC3L4, GAS7, SREBF1, ACOT7, and RORA. Higher placental expression of TNFAIP2 and ACOT7 and lower expression of RORA were associated with lower birth weight z-scores (p-values <0.05). CONCLUSION: Cd-associated differential DNAM and corresponding DNAM-expression associations were observed at loci involved in inflammatory signaling and cell growth. The expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory signaling (TNFAIP2, ACOT7, and RORA) were also associated with birth weight, suggesting a role for inflammatory processes in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by developing different machine learning (ML) models based on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) methylation and environmental stress. Methods: The data were collected from 291 patients with MDD and 100 healthy control participants: individual basic information, the Negative Life Events Scale (NLES) scores, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores and the methylation level at 38 CpG sites in TPH2. Information gain was used to select critical input variables. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to build recognition models, which were evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to evaluate features importance. Results: Gender, NLES scores, CTQ scores and 13 CpG sites in TPH2 gene were considered as predictors in the models. Three ML algorithms showed satisfactory performance in predicting MDD and the BPNN model indicated best prediction effects. Conclusion: ML models with TPH2 methylation and environmental stress were identified to possess great performance in identifying patients with MDD, which provided precious experience for artificial intelligence to assist traditional diagnostic methods in the future.

AB  - Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147/BSG) is a transmembrane glycoprotein mediating oncogenic processes partly through its role as binding partner for monocarboxylate transporter MCT4/SLC16A3. As demonstrated for MCT4, CD147 is proposed to be associated with progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this study, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of CD147 in comparison to MCT4/SLC16A3 expression and DNA methylation. Methods: CD147 protein expression was assessed in two independent ccRCC-cohorts (n = 186, n = 59) by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays and subsequent manual as well as automated software-supported scoring (Tissue Studio, Definien sAG). Epigenetic regulation of CD147 was investigated using RNAseq and DNA methylation data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. These results were validated in our cohort. Relevance of prognostic models for cancer-specific survival, comprising CD147 and MCT4 expression or SLC16A3 DNA methylation, was compared using chi-square statistics. Results: CD147 protein expression generated with Tissue Studio correlated significantly with those from manual scoring (P < 0.0001, rS = 0.85), indicating feasibility of software-based evaluation exemplarily for the membrane protein CD147 in ccRCC. Association of CD147 expression with patient outcome differed between cohorts. DNA methylation in the CD147/BSG promoter was not associated with expression. Comparison of prognostic relevance of CD147/BSG and MCT4/SLC16A3, showed higher significance for MCT4 expression and superior prognostic power for DNA methylation at specific CpG-sites in the SLC16A3 promoter (e.g. CD147 protein: P = 0.7780,Harrell's c-index = 53.7% vs. DNA methylation: P = 0.0076, Harrell's c-index = 80.0%). Conclusions: Prognostic significance of CD147 protein expression could not surpass that of MCT4, especially of SLC16A3 DNA methylation, corroborating the role of MCT4 as prognostic biomarker for ccRCC.

AB  - Maternal childhood adversity and trauma may elicit biological changes that impact the next generation through epigenetic responses measured in DNA methylation (DNAm). These epigenetic associations could be modified by the early postnatal environment through protective factors, such as early childhood home visiting (HV) programs that aim to mitigate deleterious intergenerational effects of adversity. In a cohort of 53 mother-child pairs recruited in 2015-2016 for the Pregnancy and Infant Development Study (Cincinnati, Ohio), we examined the association between maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and neonatal DNAm in the secretogranin V gene (SCG5), which is important in neuroendocrine function. We examined prenatal HV as an effect modifier. Mothers completed a questionnaire on ACEs during pregnancy, and infant buccal samples were collected 1 month postpartum. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between maternal ACEs and neonatal DNAm expressed as M-values averaged across 4 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide sites. A higher number of maternal ACEs (>3) was associated with a 5.79-percentage-point lower offspring DNAm (95% confidence interval: -10.44, -1.14), and the association was modified by the number of home visits received during pregnancy. In a population of at-risk mother-child dyads, preliminary evidence suggests that maternal ACEs have a relationship with offspring SCG5 DNAm that differs by the amount of prenatal HV.

AB  - Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is a Mendelian syndromic intellectual disability (ID) condition associated with hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, and characteristic facies caused by pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene. Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rare KMT2A variants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature for KMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2A gene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease.

AB  - Heterozygous ARID1B variants result in Coffin-Siris syndrome. Features may include hypoplastic nails, slow growth, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Most reported cases are due to ARID1B loss of function variants. We report a boy with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, aspiration, recurrent respiratory infections, slow growth, and hypotonia without a clinical diagnosis, where a previously unreported ARID1B missense variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. The pathogenicity of this variant was refined through combined methodologies including genome-wide methylation signature analysis (EpiSign), Machine Learning (ML) facial phenotyping, and LIRICAL. Trio exome sequencing and EpiSign were performed. ML facial phenotyping compared facial images using FaceMatch and GestaltMatcher to syndrome-specific libraries to prioritize the trio exome bioinformatic pipeline gene list output. Phenotype-driven variant prioritization was performed with LIRICAL. A de novo heterozygous missense variant, ARID1B p.(Tyr1268His), was reported as a variant of uncertain significance. The ACMG classification was refined to likely pathogenic by a supportive methylation signature, ML facial phenotyping, and prioritization through LIRICAL. The ARID1B genotype-phenotype has been expanded through an extended analysis of missense variation through genome-wide methylation signatures, ML facial phenotyping, and likelihood-ratio gene prioritization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of creatine monohydrate (CMH) supplementation on global DNA methylation and disease-specific clinical symptoms in female patients with Rett syndrome (RTT). METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial of female patients with RTT. Participants received 200 mg/kg of either CMH or placebo daily for 6 months and switched following a 4-week washout period. Primary endpoints were change in global DNA methylation and in a RTT-specific symptom score as defined by medical history and clinical evaluation with Rett Syndrome Motor and Behavioral Assessment. Secondary endpoints were changes in biochemical markers of methionine metabolism. RESULTS: Eighteen female patients aged 3 to 25 years with clinically diagnosed typical RTT and MECP2 mutation at clinical Stages III or IV were studied. CMH supplementation resulted in a statistically significant increase of global methylation by 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.19, p = .009) compared with placebo. Total and subscores of Rett Syndrome Motor and Behavioral Assessment tended to improve but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: CMH supplementation increases global DNA methylation statistically significantly. Scores were lower for creatine than for placebo reflecting clinical improvement but not reaching statistical significance. Biochemical variables of methionine-homocysteine remethylation are unaffected. Multicenter studies are urgently warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of CMH supplementation in an optimally homogenous RTT population over a prolonged period.

AB  - Craniosynostosis may present in isolation, 'non-syndromic', or with additional congenital anomalies/neurodevelopmental disorders, 'syndromic'. Clinical focus shifted from confirming classical syndromic cases to offering genetic testing to all craniosynostosis patients. This retrospective study assesses diagnostic yield of molecular testing by investigating prevalences of chromosomal and monogenic (likely) pathogenic variants in an 11-year cohort of 1020 craniosynostosis patients. 502 children underwent genetic testing. Pathogenic variants were identified in 174 patients (35%). Diagnostic yield was significantly higher in syndromic craniosynostosis (62%) than in non-syndromic craniosynostosis (6%). Before whole exome sequencing (WES) emerged, single-gene testing was performed using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Diagnostic yield was 11% and was highest for EFNB1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and IL11RA. Diagnostic yield for copy number variant analysis using microarray was 8%. From 2015 onwards, the WES craniosynostosis panel was implemented, with a yield of 10%. In unsolved, mainly syndromic, cases suspected of a genetic cause, additional WES panels (multiple congenital anomalies (MCA)/intellectual disability (ID)) or open exome analysis were performed with an 18% diagnostic yield. To conclude, microarray and the WES craniosynostosis panel are key to identifying pathogenic variants. in craniosynostosis patients. Given the advances in genetic diagnostics, we should look beyond the scope of the WES craniosynostosis panel and consider extensive genetic diagnostics (e.g. open exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and episignature analysis) if no diagnosis is obtained through microarray and/or WES craniosynostosis panel. If parents are uncomfortable with more extensive diagnostics, MCA or ID panels may be considered. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Context Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) (mainly secondary to 11p15 molecular disruption) and Temple syndrome (TS) (secondary to 14q32.2 molecular disruption) are imprinting disorders with phenotypic (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, early feeding difficulties) and molecular overlap. Objective To describe the clinical overlap between SRS and TS and extensively study the molecular aspects of TS. Patients We retrospectively collected data on 28 patients with disruption of the 14q32.2 imprinted region, identified in our center, and performed extensive molecular analysis. Results Seventeen (60.7%) patients showed loss of methylation of the MEG3/DLK1 intergenic differentially methylated region by epimutation. Eight (28.6%) patients had maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 and three (10.7%) had a paternal deletion in 14q32.2. Most patients (72.7%) had a Netchine-Harbison SRS clinical scoring system ≥4/6, and consistent with a clinical diagnosis of SRS. The mean age at puberty onset was 7.2 years in girls and 9.6 years in boys; 37.5% had premature pubarche. The body mass index of all patients increased before pubarche and/or the onset of puberty. Multilocus analysis identified multiple methylation defects in 58.8% of patients. We identified four potentially damaging genetic variants in genes encoding proteins involved in the establishment or maintenance of DNA methylation. Conclusions Most patients with 14q32.2 disruption fulfill the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of SRS. These clinical data suggest similar management of patients with TS and SRS, with special attention to their young age at the onset of puberty and early increase of body mass index.

AB  - Episignatures are popular tools for the diagnosis of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.

AB  - Within-pair comparison of monozygotic (MZ) twins provides an ideal model for studying factors that regulate epigenetic profile, by controlling for genetic variation. Previous reports have demonstrated epigenetic variability within MZ pairs, but the contribution of early life exposures to this variation remains unclear. As epigenetic marks govern gene expression, we have used gene expression discordance as a proxy measure of epigenetic discordance in MZ twins at birth in two cell types. We found strong evidence of expression discordance at birth in both cell types and some evidence for higher discordance in twin pairs with separate placentas. Genes previously defined as being involved in response to the external environment showed the most variable expression within pairs, independent of cell type, supporting the idea that even slight differences in intrauterine environment can influence expression profile. Focusing on birthweight, previously identified as a predisposing factor for cardiovascular, metabolic and other complex diseases, and using a statistical model that estimated association based on within-pair variation of expression and birthweight, we found some association between birthweight and expression of genes involved in metabolism and cardiovascular function. This study is the first to examine expression discordance in newborn twins. It provides evidence of a link between birthweight and activity of specific cellular pathways and, as evidence points to gene expression profiles being maintained through cell division by epigenetic factors, provides a plausible biological mechanism for the previously described link between low birthweight and increased risk of later complex disease.

AB  - In the present chapter, we review the literature focusing on oxytocin (OT)-centered research in anxiety spectrum conditions, comprising separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and anxiety-related endophenotypes (e.g., trust behavior, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and state/trait anxiety). OT receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms have been implicated in gene–environment interactions with attachment style and childhood maltreatment and to influence clinical outcomes, including SAD intensity and limbic responsiveness. Epigenetic OXTR DNA methylation patterns have emerged as a link between categorical, dimensional, neuroendocrinological, and neuroimaging SAD correlates, highlighting them as potential peripheral surrogates of the central oxytocinergic tone. A pathophysiological framework of OT integrating the dynamic nature of epigenetic biomarkers and the summarized genetic and peripheral evidence is proposed. Finally, we emphasize opportunities and challenges of OT as a key network node of social interaction and fear learning in social contexts. In conjunction with multi-level investigations incorporating a dimensional understanding of social affiliation and avoidance in anxiety spectrum disorders, these concepts will help to promote research for diagnostic, state, and treatment response biomarkers of the OT system, advancing towards indicated preventive interventions and personalized treatment approaches.

AB  - Lifelong health is thought to be partially set during intrauterine life by persistent epigenetic changes induced by the prenatal environment. To evaluate this hypothesis, we initiated a prospective longitudinal study in monochorionic (MC) twins: the TwinLIFE study. MC twins are monozygotic, thus in origin genetically identical, and share a single placenta. Although MC twins have many environmental factors in common, in one-third of the MC twin pairs, one fetus has significantly less access to nutrients and resources during pregnancy than its co-twin often resulting in a significant discordance in prenatal growth. Hence, MC twins constitute a unique natural experiment to study the influence of the prenatal environment on health. In TwinLIFE, we will chart intrapair differences in DNA methylation focusing on mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from cord as an advanced proxy of epigenetic dysregulation relevant for long-term health consequences. Next, we will follow up the MC twins for growth, cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood and evaluate the impact of an epigenetic signature at birth on future health. The current target is to include 100 MC twin pairs, but we aim to continue enrollment after procuring additional funding. TwinLIFE will not only address an unmet clinical need in the high-risk group of MC twins, but may also advance early-life strategies to prevent adverse growth, cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the general population.

AB  - Rapid postnatal growth is associated with increased risk of childhood adiposity. The aim of this study was to establish whether this pathway is mediated by altered DNA methylation and gene expression. Two distinct cohorts, one preterm (n=121) and one term born (n=6,990), were studied. Exploratory analyses were performed using microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in whole blood from children defined as "slow" (n=10) compared with "rapid" (n=10) postnatal (term to 12 weeks corrected age) growers. Methylation within the identified TACSTD2 gene was measured in both cohorts, and rs61779296 genotype was determined by Pyrosequencing or imputation and analyzed in relation to body composition at 9-15 years of age. In cohort 1, TACSTD2 expression was inversely correlated with methylation (P=0.016), and both measures were associated with fat mass (expression, P=0.049; methylation, P=0.037). Although associated with gene expression (cohort 1, P=0.008) and methylation (cohort 1, P=2.98x10(-11); cohort 2, P=3.43x10(-15)), rs61779296 was not associated with postnatal growth or fat mass in either cohort following multiple regression analysis. Hence, the lack of association between fat mass and a methylation proxy SNP suggests that reverse causation or confounding may explain the initial association between fat mass and gene regulation. Noncausal methylation patterns may still be useful predictors of later adiposity.

AB  - In the present study, try to investigation the function of cyclin dependent kinase in nasopharynx tumor. Sixty (60) nasopharynx tissues (formalin-fixed) in paraffin embedded were gained from clinics hospitals and private laboratories of mid Euphrates in Iraq. In this investigation, forty sample from patients with nasopharyngeal cancer and twenty from non-tumor (benign) nasopharyngeal tissue as control group. The age of these people (patients and control group) were distribute from 3 to 76 years. Patient samples were collected from the Histopathology Laboratory Archives of hopitals in Baghdad, Najaf, Karbala, Al Hilla, as well as from numerous private histopathology-lab that have helped in diagnosis. In this study, by IHC technique detected CDKs in NPC in 47.5% (19 out of 40 cases) and in benign in 15% (3 out of 20 cases). The higher percentage of NPC-CDKs according to these x find in males (32.5%) while infemales (15%) and the higher percentage of NPC-CDKs by age was found. In addition, the higher percentage of NPC-CDKs according to the age was found to be 15% in age group between (51-60 years) and the most percentage of nasopharyngeal grade 3 (undifferentiated NPC III) (19 %) was found. Our results show that the protein expression mutant CDKs could contribute to the development of nasopharyngeal tumor subsets. The variances between the percentages of CDKs detection in tissues NPC were statistically highly significant (chi-square < 0.0001).

AB  - Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders customarily present with complex and overlapping symptoms, complicating the clinical diagnosis. Individuals with a growing number of the so-called rare disorders exhibit unique, disorder-specific DNA methylation patterns, consequent to the underlying gene defects. Besides providing insights to the pathophysiology and molecular biology of these disorders, we can use these epigenetic patterns as functional biomarkers for the screening and diagnosis of these conditions. This review summarizes our current understanding of DNA methylation episignatures in rare disorders and describes the underlying technology and analytical approaches. We discuss the computational parameters, including statistical and machine learning methods, used for the screening and classification of genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance. Describing the rationale and principles applied to the specific computational models that are used to develop and adapt the DNA methylation episignatures for the diagnosis of rare disorders, we highlight the opportunities and challenges in this emerging branch of diagnostic medicine.

AB  - The challenges and ambiguities in providing an accurate diagnosis for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders have led researchers to apply epigenetics as a technique to validate the diagnosis provided based on the clinical examination and genetic testing results. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has recently been adapted for clinical testing of patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In this paper, preliminary data demonstrating a DNA methylation signature for Renpenning syndrome (RENS1 – OMIM 309500), which is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is reported. The identified episignature was then utilized to construct a highly sensitive and specific binary classification model. Besides providing evidence for the existence of a DNA methylation episignature for Renpenning syndrome, this study increases the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to the disease. Moreover, the availability of more subjects in future may facilitate the establishment of an episignature that can be utilized for diagnosis in a clinical setting and for reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance.

AB  - A growing number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders are known to be associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns, called episignatures, which are detectable in peripheral blood. The intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic, Armfield type (MRXSA) is caused by missense variants in FAM50A. Functional studies revealed the pathogenesis to be a spliceosomopathy that is characterized by atypical mRNA processing during development. In this study, we assessed the peripheral blood specimens in a cohort of individuals with MRXSA and detected a unique and highly specific DNA methylation episignature associated with this disorder. We used this episignature to construct a support vector machine model capable of sensitive and specific identification of individuals with pathogenic variants in FAM50A. This study contributes to the expanding number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with defined DNA methylation episignatures, provides an additional understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms, and further enhances our ability to diagnose patients with rare disorders.

AB  - Objective: Major depressive disorder is associated with an increased risk of mortality and aging-related diseases. The authors examined whether major depression is associated with higher epigenetic aging in blood as measured by DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, whether clinical characteristics of major depression have a further impact on these patterns, and whether the findings replicate in brain tissue. Method: DNAm age was estimated using all methylation sites in blood of 811 depressed patients and 319 control subjects with no lifetime psychiatric disorders and low depressive symptoms from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. The residuals of the DNAm age estimates regressed on chronological age were calculated to indicate epigenetic aging. Major depression diagnosis and clinical characteristics were assessed with questionnaires and psychiatric interviews. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health status. Postmortem brain samples of 74 depressed patients and 64 control subjects were used for replication. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using ConsensusPathDB to gain insight into the biological processes underlying epigenetic aging in blood and brain. Results: Significantly higher epigenetic aging was observed in patients with major depression compared with control subjects (Cohen's d=0.18), with a significant dose effect with increasing symptom severity in the overall sample. In the depression group, epigenetic aging was positively and significantly associated with childhood trauma score. The case-control difference was replicated in an independent data set of postmortem brain samples. The top significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms included neuronal processes. Conclusions: As compared with control subjects, patients with major depression exhibited higher epigenetic aging in blood and brain tissue, suggesting that they are biologically older than their corresponding chronological age. This effect was even more profound in the presence of childhood trauma.

AB  - Context: Children born small-for-gestational-age with short stature (SGA-SS) is associated with (epi)genetic defects, including imprinting disorders (IDs), pathogenic copy number variants (PCNVs), and pathogenic variants of genes involved in growth. However, comprehensive studies evaluating these 3 factors are very limited. Objective: To clarify the contribution of PCNVs and candidate pathogenic variants to SGA-SS. Design: Comprehensive molecular analyses consisting of methylation analysis, copy number analysis, and multigene sequencing. Methods: We enrolled 140 patients referred to us for genetic testing for SGA-SS. Among them, we excluded 42 patients meeting Netchine- Harbison clinical scoring system criteria for Silver-Russell syndrome and 4 patients with abnormal methylation levels of the IDs-related differentially methylated regions. Consequently, we conducted copy number analysis and multigene sequencing for 86 SGA-SS patients with sufficient sample volume. We also evaluated clinical phenotypes of patients with PCNVs or candidate pathogenic variants. Results: We identified 8 (9.3%) and 11 (12.8%) patients with PCNVs and candidate pathogenic variants, respectively. According to the American College of Medical Genetics standards and guidelines, 5 variants were classified as pathogenic and the remaining 6 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Genetic diagnosis was made in 12 patients. All patients with PCNVs or candidate pathogenic variants did not correspond perfectly to characteristic clinical features of each specific genetic cause. Conclusion: We clarified the contribution of PCNVs and pathogenic variants to SGA-SS without IDs. Comprehensive molecular analyses, including copy number analysis and multigene sequencing, should be considered for patients with unknown SGA-SS etiology.

AB  - Background: As opposed to other neurobehavioral disorders, epigenetic analyses and biomarkers are largely missing in the case of idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS). Objectives: Our aims were to develop a biomarker for RLS based on DNA methylation in blood and to examine DNA methylation in brain tissues for dissecting RLS pathophysiology. Methods: Methylation of blood DNA from three independent cohorts (n = 2283) and post-mortem brain DNA from two cohorts (n = 61) was assessed by Infinium EPIC 850 K BeadChip. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results of individual cohorts were combined by random-effect meta-analysis. A three-stage selection procedure (discovery, n = 884; testing, n = 520; validation, n = 879) established an epigenetic risk score including 30 CpG sites. Epigenetic age was assessed by Horvath's multi-tissue clock and Shireby's cortical clock. Results: EWAS meta-analysis revealed 149 CpG sites linked to 136 genes (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) in blood and 23 CpG linked to 18 genes in brain (false discovery rate [FDR] < 5%). Gene-set analyses of blood EWAS results suggested enrichments in brain tissue types and in subunits of the kainate-selective glutamate receptor complex. Individual candidate genes of the brain EWAS could be assigned to neurodevelopmental or metabolic traits. The blood epigenetic risk score achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 (0.67–0.73) in the validation set, comparable to analogous scores in other neurobehavioral disorders. A significant difference in biological age in blood or brain of RLS patients was not detectable. Conclusions: DNA methylation supports the notion of altered neurodevelopment in RLS. Epigenetic risk scores are reliably associated with RLS but require even higher accuracy to be useful as biomarkers. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background Women with a history of complications of pregnancy, including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes or an infant fetal growth restriction or preterm birth, are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. We aimed to examine differences in maternal DNA methylation following pregnancy complications. Methods Data on women participating in the Young Finns study (n = 836) were linked to the national birth registry. DNA methylation in whole blood was assessed using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Epigenome-wide analysis was conducted on differential CpG methylation at 850 K sites. Reproductive history was also modeled as a predictor of four epigenetic age indices. Results Fourteen significant differentially methylated sites were found associated with both history of pre-eclampsia and overall hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. No associations were found between reproductive history and any epigenetic age acceleration measure. Conclusions Differences in epigenetic methylation profiles could represent pre-existing risk factors, or changes that occurred as a result of experiencing these complications.

AB  - In termites, division of labor among castes, categories of individuals that perform specialized tasks, increases colony-level productivity and is the key to their ecological success. Although molecular studies on caste polymorphism have been performed in termites, we are far from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of this phenomenon. To facilitate future molecular studies, we aimed to construct expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries covering wide ranges of gene repertoires in three representative termite species, Hodotermopsis sjostedti, Reticulitermes speratus and Nasutitermes takasagoensis. We generated normalized cDNA libraries from whole bodies, except for guts containing microbes, of almost all castes, sexes and developmental stages and sequenced them with the 454 GS FLX titanium system. We obtained >1.2 million quality-filtered reads yielding >400 million bases for each of the three species. Isotigs, which are analogous to individual transcripts, and singletons were produced by assembling the reads and annotated using public databases. Genes related to juvenile hormone, which plays crucial roles in caste differentiation of termites, were identified from the EST libraries by BLAST search. To explore the potential for DNA methylation, which plays an important role in caste differentiation of honeybees, tBLASTn searches for DNA methyltransferases (dnmt1, dnmt2 and dnmt3) and methyl-CpG binding domain (mbd) were performed against the EST libraries. All four of these genes were found in the H. sjostedti library, while all except dnmt3 were found in R. speratus and N. takasagoensis. The ratio of the observed to the expected CpG content (CpG O/E), which is a proxy for DNA methylation level, was calculated for the coding sequences predicted from the isotigs and singletons. In all of the three species, the majority of coding sequences showed depletion of CpG O/E (less than 1), and the distributions of CpG O/E were bimodal, suggesting the presence of DNA methylation.

AB  - While DNA serves as the fundamental genetic blueprint for an organism, it is not a static entity. Gene expression, the process by which genetic information is utilized to create functional products like proteins, can be modulated by a diverse range of environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs, play a pivotal role in mediating the intricate interplay between the environment and gene expression. Intriguingly, alterations in the epigenome have the potential to be inherited across generations. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) poses significant health issues worldwide. Alcohol has the capability to induce changes in the epigenome, which can be inherited by offspring, thus impacting them even in the absence of direct alcohol exposure. This review delves into the impact of alcohol on the epigenome, examining how its effects vary based on factors such as the age of exposure (adolescence or adulthood), the duration of exposure (chronic or acute), and the specific sample collected (brain, blood, or sperm). The literature underscores that alcohol exposure can elicit diverse effects on the epigenome during different life stages. Furthermore, compelling evidence from human and animal studies demonstrates that alcohol induces alterations in epigenome content, affecting both the brain and blood. Notably, rodent studies suggest that these epigenetic changes can result in lasting phenotype alterations that extend across at least two generations. In conclusion, the comprehensive literature analysis supports the notion that alcohol exposure induces lasting epigenetic alterations, influencing the behavior and health of future generations. This knowledge emphasizes the significance of addressing the potential transgenerational effects of alcohol and highlights the importance of preventive measures to minimize the adverse impact on offspring.

AB  - Introduction: DNA methylation studies have associated methylation levels at different CpG sites or genomic regions with lung function. Moreover, genetic ancestry has been associated with lung function in Latinos. However, no epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of lung function has been performed in this population. Here, we aimed to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with lung function in pediatric asthma among Latinos. Results: We conducted an EWAS in whole blood from 250 Puerto Rican and 148 Mexican American children and young adults with asthma. A total of five CpGs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold of p = 1.17 × 10−7 in the combined analyses from Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans: cg06035600 (MAP3K6, p = 6.13 × 10−8) showed significant association with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau–Pinelli index, the probes cg00914963 (TBC1D16, p = 1.04 × 10−7), cg16405908 (MRGPRE, p = 2.05 × 10−8), and cg07428101 (MUC2, p = 5.02 × 10−9) were associated with post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), and cg20515679 (KCNJ6) with post-bronchodilator Tiffeneau–Pinelli index (p = 1.13 × 10−8). However, these markers did not show significant associations in publicly available data from Europeans (p > 0.05). A methylation quantitative trait loci analysis revealed that methylation levels at these CpG sites were regulated by genetic variation in Latinos and the Biobank-based Integrative Omics Studies (BIOS) consortium. Additionally, two differentially methylated regions in REXOC and AURKC were associated with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau–Pinelli index (adjusted p < 0.05) in Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. Moreover, we replicated some of the previous differentially methylated signals associated with lung function in non-Latino populations. Conclusions: We replicated previous associations of epigenetic markers with lung function in whole blood and identified novel population-specific associations shared among Latino subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A breast cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) comprising 313 common variants reliably predicts disease risk. We examined possible relationships between genetic variation, regulation, and expression to clarify the molecular alterations associated with these variants. METHODS: Genome-wide methylomic variation was quantified (MethylationEPIC) in Asian breast cancer patients (1152 buffy coats from peripheral whole blood). DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping was performed for 235 of the 313 variants with minor allele frequencies > 5%. Stability of identified mQTLs (p < 5e-8) across lifetime was examined using a public mQTL database. Identified mQTLs were also mapped to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and the eQTLGen Consortium. RESULTS: Breast cancer PRS was not associated with DNAm. A higher proportion of significant cis-mQTLs were observed. Of 822 significant cis-mQTLs (179 unique variants) identified in our dataset, 141 (59 unique variants) were significant (p < 5e-8) in a public mQTL database. Eighty-six percent (121/141) of the matched mQTLs were consistent at multiple time points (birth, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, middle age, post-diagnosis, or treatment). Ninety-three variants associated with DNAm were also cis-eQTLs (35 variants not genome-wide significant). Multiple loci in the breast cancer PRS are associated with DNAm, contributing to the polygenic nature of the disease. These mQTLs are mostly stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent results from DNAm and expression data may reveal new candidate genes not previously associated with breast cancer. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, a T-cell neoplasm, is primarily a pediatric disease. Seventy-five percent of pediatric anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cases harbor the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) leading to the ectopic expression of NPM-ALK, a chimeric tyrosine kinase. NPM-ALK consists of an N-terminal nucleophosmin (NPM) domain fused to an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) cytoplasmic domain. Pediatric NPM-ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is often a disseminated disease and young patients are prone to chemoresistance or relapse shortly after chemotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore, there is no gold standard protocol for the treatment of relapses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the potential role of the microRNA, miR-497, in NPM-ALK+ anaplastic largecell lymphoma tumorigenesis. Our results show that miR-497 expression is repressed in NPM-ALK+ cell lines and patient samples through the hypermethylation of its promoter and the activity of NPM-ALK is responsible for this epigenetic repression. We demonstrate that overexpression of miR-497 in human NPM-ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cells inhibits cellular growth and causes cell cycle arrest by targeting CDK6, E2F3 and CCNE1, the three regulators of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, we show that a scoring system based on CDK6, E2F3 and CCNE1 expression could help to identify relapsing pediatric patients. In addition, we demonstrate the sensitivity of NPMALK+ cells to CDK4/6 inhibition using for the first time a selective inhibitor, palbociclib. Together, our findings suggest that CDK6 could be a therapeutic target for the development of future treatments for NPMALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common morbidity among very preterm infants, is associated with chronic disease and neurodevelopmental impairments. A hypothesized mechanism for these outcomes lies in altered glucocorticoid (GC) activity. We hypothesized that BPD and its treatments may result in epigenetic differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is modulated by GC, and could be ascertained using an established GC risk score and DNA methylation (DNAm) of HPA axis genes. METHODS: DNAm was quantified from buccal tissue (ECHO-NOVI) and from neonatal blood spots (ELGAN ECHO) via the EPIC microarray. Prenatal maternal characteristics, pregnancy complication, and neonatal medical complication data were collected from medical record review and maternal interviews. RESULTS: The GC score was not associated with steroid exposure or BPD. However, six HPA genes involved in stress response regulation demonstrated differential methylation with antenatal steroid exposure; two CpGs within FKBP5 and POMC were differentially methylated with BPD severity. These findings were sex-specific in both cohorts; males had greater magnitude of differential methylation within these genes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BPD severity and antenatal steroids are associated with DNAm at some HPA genes in very preterm infants and the effects appear to be sex-, tissue-, and age-specific. IMPACT: This study addresses bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), an important health outcome among preterm neonates, and interrogates a commonly studied pathway, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The combination of BPD, the HPA axis, and epigenetic markers has not been previously reported. In this study, we found that BPD itself was not associated with epigenetic responses in the HPA axis in infants born very preterm; however, antenatal treatment with steroids was associated with epigenetic responses.

AB  - Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by short stature, delayed osseous maturation, expressive language impairment, and unique facial dysmorphology. We previously identified mutations in the chromatin remodeling protein SRCAP (SNF2-related CBP Activator Protein) as the cause of FHS. SRCAP has multiple roles in chromatin and transcriptional regulation; however, specific epigenetic consequences of SRCAP mutations remain to be described. Using high resolution genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, we identified a unique and highly specific DNA methylation "epi-signature" in the peripheral blood of individuals with FHS. Both hyper and hypomethylated loci are distributed across the genome, preferentially occurring in CpG islands. Clonal bisulfite sequencing of two hypermethylated (FIGN and STPG2) and two hypomethylated (MYO1F and RASIP1) genes confirmed these findings. The identification of a unique methylation signature in FHS provides further insight into the biological function of SRCAP and provides a unique biomarker for this disorder.

AB  - Verheij syndrome [VRJS; OMIM 615583] is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinct clinical features, including growth retardation, intellectual disability, cardiac, and renal anomalies. VRJS is caused by deletions of chromosome 8q24.3 or pathogenic variants in the PUF60 gene. Recently, pathogenic PUF60 variants have been reported in some individuals with VRJS, contributing to the variability in the clinical presentation and severity of the condition. PUF60 encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and cellular growth. In this report, we describe a new case of VRJS with developmental delay, cardiac-, and renal abnormalities, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic PUF60 variant. Surprisingly, DNA methylation analysis revealed a pattern resembling the Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) episignature, suggesting a potential connection between PUF60 and CdLS-related genes. This case report further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of VRJS and supports further research to validate the interaction between VRJS and CdLS.

AB  - The environment and events that we are exposed to in utero, during birth and in early childhood influence our future physical and mental health. The underlying mechanisms that lead to these outcomes are unclear, but long-term changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, could act as a mediating factor or biomarker. DNA methylation data were assayed at 713 522 CpG sites from 9537 participants of the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, a family-based cohort with extensive genetic, medical, family history and lifestyle information. Methylome-wide association studies of eight early life environment phenotypes and two adult mental health phenotypes (major depressive disorder and brief resilience scale) were conducted using DNA methylation data collected from adult whole blood samples. Two genes involved with different developmental pathways (PRICKLE2, Prickle Planar Cell Polarity Protein 2 and ABI1, Abl-Interactor-1) were annotated to CpG sites associated with preterm birth (P < 1.27 × 10-9). A further two genes important to the development of sensory pathways (SOBP, Sine Oculis Binding Protein Homolog and RPGRIP1, Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator Interacting Protein) were annotated to sites associated with low birth weight (P < 4.35 × 10-8). The examination of methylation profile scores and genes and gene-sets annotated from associated CpGs sites found no evidence of overlap between the early life environment and mental health conditions. Birth date was associated with a significant difference in estimated lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Previous studies have shown that early life environments influence the risk of developing mental health disorders later in life; however, this study found no evidence that this is mediated by stable changes to the methylome detectable in peripheral blood.

AB  - We investigated gene-environment effects on structural brain endophenotype in bipolar disorder (BD) using a novel method of combining polygenic risk scores with epigenetic signatures since traditional methods of examining the family history and trauma effects have significant limitations. The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).

AB  - Background: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterized by growth failure and dysmorphic features. Major (epi)genetic causes of SRS are loss of methylation on chromosome 11p15 (11p15 LOM) and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat). However, IGF2, CDKN1C, HMGA2, and PLAG1 mutations infrequently cause SRS. In addition, other imprinting disturbances, pathogenic copy number variations (PCNVs), and monogenic disorders sometimes lead to SRS phenotype. This study aimed to clarify the frequency and clinical features of the patients with gene mutations among etiology-unknown patients with SRS phenotype. Results: Multigene sequencing was performed in 92 out of 336 patients referred to us for genetic testing for SRS. The clinical features of the patients were evaluated based on the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system. None of the patients showed 11p15 LOM, upd(7)mat, abnormal methylation levels for six differentially methylated regions (DMRs), namely, PLAGL1:alt-TSS-DMR on chromosome 6, KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR on chromosome 11, MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR on chromosome 14, MEG3:TSS-DMR on chromosome 14, SNURF:TSS-DMR on chromosome 15, and GNAS A/B:TSS-DMR on chromosome 20, PCNVs, or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16. Using next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing, we screened four SRS-causative genes and 406 genes related to growth failure and/or skeletal dysplasia. We identified four pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in responsible genes for SRS (4.3%: IGF2 in two patients, CDKN1C, and PLAG1), and five pathogenic variants in causative genes for known genetic syndromes presenting with growth failure (5.4%: IGF1R abnormality (IGF1R), SHORT syndrome (PIK3R1), Floating-Harbor syndrome (SRCAP), Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (TCF4), and Noonan syndrome (PTPN11)). Functional analysis indicated the pathogenicity of the CDKN1C variant. The variants we detected in CDKN1C and PLAG1 were the second and third variants leading to SRS, respectively. Our patients with CDKN1C and PLAG1 variants showed similar phenotypes to previously reported patients. Furthermore, our data confirmed IGF1R abnormality, SHORT syndrome, and Floating-Harbor syndrome are differential diagnoses of SRS because of the shared phenotypes among these syndromes and SRS. On the other hand, the patients with pathogenic variants in causative genes for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and Noonan syndrome were atypical of these syndromes and showed partial clinical features of SRS. Conclusions: We identified nine patients (9.8%) with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants out of 92 etiology-unknown patients with SRS phenotype. This study expands the molecular spectrum of SRS phenotype.

Sixty-three satisfied the Netchine-harbison clinical scoring system (Nh-CSS) criteria, and 25 out of 63 patients showed both protruding forehead and relative macrocephaly (clinical SrS). the remaining 31 patients met only three Nh-CSS criteria, but were clinically suspected as having SrS. to detect UpD(16)mat, we performed methylation analysis for the ZNF597:tSS-differentially methylated region (DMr) on chromosome 16 and subsequently performed microsatellite, SNp array and exome analyses in the patients with hypomethylated ZNF597:tSS-DMr. results We identified two patients (2.1%) with a mixture of maternal isodisomy and heterodisomy of chromosome 16 in 94 aetiology-unknown patients with SrS phenotype. Both patients exhibited preterm birth and prenatal and postnatal growth failure. the male patient had ventricular septal defect and hypospadias. Whole-exome sequencing detected no gene mutations related to their phenotypes. Conclusion We suggest considering genetic testing for UpD(16)mat in SrS phenotypic patients without known aetiology.

AB  - Background: Register-based reproductive and perinatal databases rarely contain detailed information from medical records or repeated measurements throughout pregnancy and delivery. This lack of enriched pregnancy and birth data led to the initiation of the Swedish Stockholm–Gotland Perinatal Cohort (SGPC). Objectives: To describe the strengths of the SGPC, as well as the unique research questions that can be addressed using this cohort. Population: The SGPC is a prospectively collected, population-based cohort that includes all births (from 22 completed gestational weeks onwards) between 1 January 2008 and 15 June 2020 in the Stockholm and Gotland regions of Sweden (335,153 singleton and 11,025 multiple pregnancies). Design: Descriptive study. Methods: The SGPC is based on the electronic medical records of women and their infants. The medical record system is used for all antenatal clinic visits and admissions, delivery and neonatal admissions, as well as postpartum clinical visits. SGPC has been further enriched with data linkages to 10 Swedish National Health Care and Quality Registers. Preliminary Results: In contrast to other reproductive and perinatal databases available in Sweden, including the Medical Birth Register and the Pregnancy Register, SGPC contains highly detailed medical record data, including time-varying serial measurements for physiological parameters throughout pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, for both mother and infant. These strengths have enabled studies that were previously inconceivable; the effects of serial measurements of pregnancy weight gain, changes in haemoglobin counts and blood pressure during pregnancy, fetal weight estimations by ultrasound, duration of stages and phases of labour, cervical dilatation and oxytocin use during delivery, and constructing reference curves for umbilical cord pH. Conclusions: The SGPC—with its rich content, repeated measurements and linkages to numerous health care and quality registers—is a unique cohort that enables high-quality perinatal studies that would otherwise not be possible.

AB  - The aim of this study, comprising 88 suicide attempters, was to identify hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis coupled CpG-sites showing methylation shifts linked to severity of the suicide attempt. Candidate methylation loci were further investigated as risk loci for a general psychiatric risk score in two cohorts of adolescents (cohort 1 and 2). The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Subjects were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the severity of the suicidal behavior. We included CpG sites located within 2000 basepairs away from transcriptional start site of the following HPA-axis coupled genes: corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). The methylation state of two corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-associated CpG sites were significantly hypomethylated in the high-risk group of suicide attempters (n=31) (cg19035496 and cg23409074) (p<0.001). Adolescent cohort 1 and 2 consisted of 129 and 93 subjects, respectively, and were stratified by the in silico generated DAWBA measurements of a general psychiatric risk score into high-risk group (>~50% risk) or controls. In adolescent cohort 2, cg19035496 was hypermethylated in subjects with a high general psychiatric risk score. Our results show epigenetic changes in the CRH gene related to severity of suicide attempt in adults and a general psychiatric risk score in adolescents. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress contributes to premature aging and susceptibility to alcohol use disorder (AUD), and AUD itself is a factor in premature aging; however, the interrelationships of stress, AUD, and premature aging are poorly understood. METHODS: We constructed a composite score of stress from 13 stress-related outcomes in a discovery cohort of 317 individuals with AUD and control subjects. We then developed a novel methylation score of stress (MS stress) as a proxy of composite score of stress comprising 211 CpGs selected using a penalized regression model. The effects of MS stress on health outcomes and epigenetic aging were assessed in a sample of 615 patients with AUD and control subjects using epigenetic clocks and DNA methylation-based telomere length. Statistical analysis with an additive model using MS stress and a MS for alcohol consumption (MS alcohol) was conducted. Results were replicated in 2 independent cohorts (Generation Scotland, N = 7028 and the Grady Trauma Project, N = 795). RESULTS: Composite score of stress and MS stress were strongly associated with heavy alcohol consumption, trauma experience, epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), and shortened DNA methylation-based telomere length in AUD. Together, MS stress and MS alcohol additively showed strong stepwise increases in EAA. Replication analyses showed robust association between MS stress and EAA in the Generation Scotland and Grady Trauma Project cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A methylation-derived score tracking stress exposure is associated with various stress-related phenotypes and EAA. Stress and alcohol have additive effects on aging, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of premature aging in AUD and, potentially, other aspects of gene dysregulation in this disorder.

AB  - Features of the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) may overlap with other entities characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, making clinical diagnosis often ambiguous. Numerous scoring systems have been continuously modified, based on anthropometric parameters, dysmorphic features and health issues, including growth and gastrointestinal disturbances. Clinical criteria serve for screening patients for further genetic tests. The latter include tests for analyzing DNA methylation of 11p15 loci and multilocus methylation/imprinting defects (MLMD/MLID). Other techniques useful for SRS diagnosis include analysis for maternal uniparental disomy (UPD(7)mat) and molecular karyotypying if submicroscopic imbalances are suspected. The recurrence risk of SRS within a family is generally estimated low; rare familial cases depend on influence of additional genetic mechanisms. Children with SRS should be under multidisciplinary care. Failure to thrive or gastroesophageal reflux require careful estimation of caloric intake and composition of foods by a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist. Growth and puberty should be followed by an endocrinologist, and treatment with recombinant or biosimilar growth hormone is available for children with SRS. Speech and physiotherapists, psychologists and neurologists are involved in management of psychomotor development. Studies in genetically confirmed cohorts of children with SRS are necessary to evaluate long-term developmental outcome and metabolic sequelae, particularly carbohydrate disturbances in this group of patients.

AB  - Children of mothers with prenatal depressive symptoms (PND) have a higher risk of behavioral problems; fetal programming through DNA methylation is a possible underlying mechanism. This study investigated DNA methylation in cord blood to identify possible "at birth" signatures that may indicate susceptibility to behavioral problems at 18 months of age. Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties. This is the first investigation of cord blood DNA methylation signs of fetal programming of PND on child behavior at 18 months of age and thus calls for independent replications. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important etiological mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Pathogenic variation in epigenetic regulators can impair deposition of histone post-translational modifications leading to aberrant spatiotemporal gene expression during neurodevelopment. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a prominent multi-subunit epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is responsible for histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). Using exome sequencing, here we identify a cohort of 25 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants in MSL complex member MSL2. MSL2 variants were associated with NDD phenotypes including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and motor issues such as coordination problems, feeding difficulties, and gait disturbance. Dysmorphisms and behavioral and/or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and to a lesser extent, seizures, connective tissue disease signs, sleep disturbance, vision problems, and other organ anomalies, were observed in affected individuals. As a molecular biomarker, a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature has been established. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from three members of our cohort exhibited reduced MSL2 levels. Remarkably, while NDD-associated variants in two other members of the MSL complex (MOF and MSL3) result in reduced H4K16ac, global H4K16ac levels are unchanged in iPSCs with MSL2 variants. Regardless, MSL2 variants altered the expression of MSL2 targets in iPSCs and upon their differentiation to early germ layers. Our study defines an MSL2-related disorder as an NDD with distinguishable clinical features, a specific blood DNA episignature, and a distinct, MSL2-specific molecular etiology compared to other MSL complex-related disorders.

AB  - Purpose: The main objective of this study was to assess clinical features and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in individuals affected by intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 21 (IDD21) syndrome, caused by variants in the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) gene. Methods: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood of 16 individuals with clinical features and genetic findings consistent with IDD21. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip microarrays. The methylation levels were fitted in a multivariate linear regression model to identify the differentially methylated probes. A binary support vector machine classification model was constructed to differentiate IDD21 samples from controls. Results: We identified a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive episignature associated with CTCF variants. Six variants of uncertain significance were tested, of which 2 mapped to the IDD21 episignature and clustered alongside IDD21 cases in both heatmap and multidimensional scaling plots. Comparison of the genomic DNA methylation profile of IDD21 with that of 56 other neurodevelopmental disorders provided insights into the underlying molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. Conclusion: The robust and specific CTCF/IDD21 episignature expands the growing list of neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct DNA methylation profiles, which can be applied as supporting evidence in variant classification.

AB  - Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations in either KMT2D on chromosome 12 or KDM6A on chromosome X, encoding a lysine methyltransferase and a lysine demethylase, respectively. A 9-year-4-month-old male patient with a normal karyotype presented with KS and autism spectrum disorder. Genetic testing for KS was conducted by Sanger sequencing and episignature analysis using DNA methylation array data. The patient had a mosaic stop-gain variant in KDM6A and a heterozygous missense variant (rs201078160) in KMT2D. The KDM6A variant is expected to be deleterious. The KMT2D variant pathogenicity has been inconsistently reported in the ClinVar database. Using biobanking resources, we identified two heterozygous individuals possessing the rs201078160 variant. In a subsequent episignature analysis, the KS patient showed the KS episignature, but two control individuals with the rs201078160 variant did not. Our results indicate that the mosaic stop-gained variant in KDM6A, but not the rs201078160 variant in KMT2D, is responsible for the KS phenotype in the patient. This study further demonstrated the utility of DNA methylation information in diagnosing rare genetic diseases and emphasized the importance of a reference dataset containing both genotype and DNA methylation information.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewEnormous progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture of obesity and the correlation of epigenetic marks with obesity and related traits. This review highlights current research and its challenges in genetics and epigenetics of obesity.Recent FindingsRecent progress in genetics of polygenic traits, particularly represented by genome-wide association studies, led to the discovery of hundreds of genetic variants associated with obesity, which allows constructing polygenic risk scores (PGS). In addition, epigenome-wide association studies helped identifying novel targets and methylation sites being important in the pathophysiology of obesity and which are essential for the generation of methylation risk scores (MRS). Despite their great potential for predicting the individual risk for obesity, the use of PGS and MRS remains challenging.SummaryFuture research will likely discover more loci being involved in obesity, which will contribute to better understanding of the complex etiology of human obesity. The ultimate goal from a clinical perspective will be generating highly robust and accurate prediction scores allowing clinicians to predict obesity as well as individual responses to body weight loss-specific life-style interventions.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the diagnostic utility and provide reporting recommendations for clinical DNA methylation episignature testing based on the cohort of patients tested through the EpiSign Clinical Testing Network. METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

AB  - The identification of rearrangements driving expression of neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) family kinases in tumors has become critically important because of the availability of effective, specific inhibitor drugs. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can identify novel and recurrent expressed fusions. Here we describe three SPECC1L–NTRK fusions identified in two pediatric central nervous system cancers and an extracranial solid tumor using WGS and RNA-seq. These fusions arose either through a simple balanced rearrangement or in the context of a complex chromoplexy event. We cloned the SPECC1L–NTRK2 fusion directly from a patient sample and showed that enforced expression of this fusion is sufficient to promote cytokine-independent survival and proliferation. Cells transformed by SPECC1L–NTRK2 expression are sensitive to a TRK inhibitor drug. We report here that SPECC1L–NTRK fusions can arise in a range of pediatric cancers. Although WGS and RNA-seq are not required to detect NTRK fusions, these techniques may be of benefit when NTRK fusions are not suspected on clinical grounds or not identified by other methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenomic (e.g., DNA methylation [DNAm]) changes have been hypothesized as intermediate step linking environmental exposures with allergic disease. Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation (DNAm) is considered a plausible pathway through which genetic and environmental factors may influence the development of allergies. However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization. Conclusion: The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.

AB  - Imprinted genes are regulated by DNA methylation of imprinted differentially methylated regions (iDMRs). An increasing number of patients with congenital imprinting disorders (IDs) exhibit aberrant methylation at multiple imprinted loci, multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). We examined MLID and its possible impact on clinical features in patients with IDs. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis (GWMA) using blood leukocyte DNA was performed on 13 patients with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), two patients with Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS), and four controls. HumanMethylation850 BeadChip analysis for 77 iDMRs (809 CpG sites) identified three patients with BWS and one patient with SRS showing additional hypomethylation, other than the disease-related iDMRs, suggestive of MLID. Two regions were aberrantly methylated in at least two patients with BWS showing MLID: PPIEL locus (chromosome 1: 39559298 to 39559744), and FAM50B locus (chromosome 6: 3849096 to 3849469). All patients with BWS- and SRS-MLID did not show any other clinical characteristics associated with additional involved iDMRs. Exome analysis in three patients with BWS who exhibited multiple hypomethylation did not identify any causative variant related to MLID. This study indicates that a genome-wide approach can unravel MLID in patients with an apparently isolated ID. Patients with MLID showed only clinical features related to the original IDs. Long-term follow-up studies in larger cohorts are warranted to evaluate any possible phenotypic consequences of other disturbed imprinted loci.

AB  - DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic modification due to its role in regulating gene expression, and its involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer and several diseases upon aberrations in methylation. The method of choice to evaluate genome-wide methylation has been the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K), but it was recently replaced with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC). We therefore sought to validate the EPIC array in comparison to the 450K array for both fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumours. We also performed analysis on the EPIC array with paired FF and FFPE samples to adapt to a clinical setting where FFPE is routinely used. Further, we compared two restoration methods, REPLI-g and Infinium, for FFPE-derived DNA on the EPIC array. The Pearson correlation of β values for common probes on the 450K and EPIC array was high for both FF (mean: 0.992) and FFPE (mean: 0.984) samples. The β values generated from the EPIC array for FFPE samples correlated well with the paired FF tumours, but varied between 0.901 and 0.987. We did note that sample pairs with lower correlation had less bimodal density distributions of β values and displayed higher noise in the copy number alteration plots (generated from the methylation array data) in the FFPE sample. Both REPLI-g and the Infinium restoration for FFPE samples performed well on the EPIC array and generated equivalent correlation scores to the paired FF sample.

AB  - Heart Failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to meet metabolic needs and lacks efficient venous return. HF is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality with cardiovascular diseases globally. Despite enormous research, the molecular markers relevant to disease prognosis and management remain not well understood. Here, we analyzed the whole transcriptomes of 18 failing hearts and 15 non-failing hearts (predominantly of Caucasian origin), by applying the standard in silico tools. The analyses revealed novel gene-markers including ALKBH5 of mRNA demethylation and KMT2E of histone modification processes, significantly over-expressed in the HF compared with the non-failing hearts (FDR < 0.05). To validate the over-expression of ALKBH5, we determined the global m6A level in hypoxic H9c2 cells using a dot blot assay. The global m6A level was found markedly lower in the hypoxic H9c2 cells than in the control cells. Additionally, the expression of ALKBH5 in the H9c2 cells was quantified by the qPCR and found to be 1.18 times higher at 12 h (p < 0.05), and 1.67 times higher at 24 h of hypoxia (p < 0.01) compared with the control cells, indicating a likely role of ALKBH5 in the failing cardiac cells. Furthermore, we identified several compounds through the virtual screening of 11,272 drug-like molecules of the ZINC15 database to inhibit the ALKBH5 in a molecular docking process. Collectively, the study revealed novel markers potentially involved in the pathophysiology of HF and suggested plausible therapeutic molecules for the management of the disease.

AB  - Genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants and differentially methylated nucleotides associated with childhood asthma. Incorporation of such genomic data may improve performance of childhood asthma prediction models which use phenotypic and environmental data. Using genome-wide genotype and methylation data at birth from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n = 1456), a polygenic risk score (PRS), and newborn (nMRS) and childhood (cMRS) methylation risk scores, were developed to predict childhood asthma diagnosis. Each risk score was integrated with two previously published childhood asthma prediction models (CAPE and CAPP) and were validated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study. Individually, the genomic risk scores demonstrated modest-to-moderate discriminative performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC: PRS = 0.64, nMRS = 0.55, cMRS = 0.54), and their integration only marginally improved the performance of the CAPE (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.71) and CAPP models (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.82). The limited predictive performance of each genomic risk score individually and their inability to substantially improve upon the performance of the CAPE and CAPP models suggests that genetic and epigenetic predictors of the broad phenotype of asthma are unlikely to have clinical utility. Hence, further studies predicting specific asthma endotypes are warranted.

AB  - SETD1B is a component of a histone methyltransferase complex that specifically methylates Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3K4) and is responsible for the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. De novo microdeletions encompassing this gene as well as de novo missense mutations were previously linked to syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Here, we identify a specific hypermethylation signature associated with loss of function mutations in the SETD1B gene which may be used as an epigenetic marker supporting the diagnosis of syndromic SETD1B-related diseases. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this unique epi-signature by reclassifying previously identified SETD1B VUS (variant of uncertain significance) in two patients.

AB  - The advent of novel genomic sequencing technologies has aided the identification of somatically acquired genetic abnormalities up to 80% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Novel recurrent genetic mutations in pathways such as RNA splicing, DNA methylation and histone modification and cohesion complexes, underscore the molecular heterogeneity seen in this clinically varied disease. Functional studies to establish a causative link between genomic aberrations and MDS biogenesis are still in their infancy. The deluge of this molecular information, once validated on a larger cohort, will be incorporated into prognostic systems and clinical practise, and also hopefully aid in MDS therapeutics, especially in guiding targeted therapy. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by pediatric systemic vasculitis of an unknown cause. The low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-a (FCGR2A) gene was reported to be involved in the susceptibility of KD. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression; thus, we hypothesized that methylation status of CpG islands in FCGR2A promoter associates with the susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes of Kawasaki disease. In this study, 36 KD patients and 24 healthy subjects from out-patient clinic were recruited. Eleven potential methylation sites within the targeted promoter region of FCGR2A were selected for investigation. We marked the eleven methylation sites from A to K. Our results indicated that methylation at the CpG sites G, H, and J associated with the risk of KD. CpG sites B, C, E, F, H, J, and K were found to associate with the outcomes of IVIG treatment. In addition, CpG sites G, J, and K were predicted as transcription factors binding sites for NF-kB, Myc-Max, and SP2, respectively. Our study reported a significant association among the promoter methylation of FCGR2A, susceptibility of KD, and the therapeutic outcomes of IVIG treatment. The methylation levels of CpG sites of FCGR2A gene promoter should be an important marker for optimizing IVIG therapy.

AB  - Birthweight is associated with health outcomes across the life course, DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. In this meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of 8,825 neonates from 24 birth cohorts in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, we find that DNA methylation in neonatal blood is associated with birthweight at 914 sites, with a difference in birthweight ranging from −183 to 178 grams per 10% increase in methylation (PBonferroni < 1.06 x 10−7). In additional analyses in 7,278 participants, <1.3% of birthweight-associated differential methylation is also observed in childhood and adolescence, but not adulthood. Birthweight-related CpGs overlap with some Bonferroni-significant CpGs that were previously reported to be related to maternal smoking (55/914, p = 6.12 x 10−74) and BMI in pregnancy (3/914, p = 1.13x10−3), but not with those related to folate levels in pregnancy. Whether the associations that we observe are causal or explained by confounding or fetal growth influencing DNA methylation (i.e. reverse causality) requires further research.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review demonstrates the growing body of evidence connecting DNA methylation to prior exposure. It highlights the potential to use DNA methylation patterns as a feasible, stable, and accurate biomarker of past exposure, opening new opportunities for environmental and gene-environment interaction studies among existing banked samples. RECENT FINDINGS: We present the evidence for association between past exposure, including prenatal exposures, and DNA methylation measured at a later time in the life course. We demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation-based biomarkers of past exposure using results from multiple studies of smoking as an example. Multiple studies show the ability to accurately predict prenatal smoking exposure based on DNA methylation measured at birth, in childhood, and even adulthood. Separate sets of DNA methylation loci have been used to predict past personal smoking exposure (postnatal) as well. Further, it appears that these two types of exposures, prenatal and previous personal exposure, can be isolated from each other. There is also a suggestion that quantitative methylation scores may be useful for estimating dose. We highlight the remaining needs for rigor in methylation biomarker development including analytic challenges as well as the need for development across multiple developmental windows, multiple tissue types, and multiple ancestries. SUMMARY: If fully developed, DNA methylation-based biomarkers can dramatically shift our ability to carry out environmental and genetic-environmental epidemiology using existing biobanks, opening up unprecedented opportunities for environmental health.

AB  - Sequence-based genetic testing currently identifies causative genetic variants in ~50% of individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations (“epivariants”) can drive disease by modulating gene expression at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can result in distinct “episignature” biomarkers for monogenic disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10 individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2 using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ~2% (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases.

AB  - Childhood obesity represents a significant global health concern and identifying its risk factors is crucial for developing intervention programs. Many "omics" factors associated with the risk of developing obesity have been identified, including genomic, microbiomic, and epigenomic factors. Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F, and PPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-life nutritional exposures may contribute to offspring epigenetic modifications. However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). OBJECTIVES: We aim to fill this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation cohort. METHODS: Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear regressions, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, whose functions involve regulation of bone development (beta = -0.0036, per 1 point increase in the score; P = 5.6 x 10-8). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell signaling gene LUZP1 (beta = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 x 10-8). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Parental dietary quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of parental nutritional programming is warranted. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methylation-specific (MS) multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) at two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at chromosome 11p15, H19-DMR and LIT1-DMR, and microsatellite analysis for uniparental disomy (UPD) at chromosome 7 or 11, have been recommended for the genetic diagnosis of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). In this study, the efficacy of the MS pyrosequencing method at H19-DMR and LIT1-DMR at 11p15 and SGCE-DMR at 7q21 was evaluated for the genetic diagnosis of BWS (n=18) and SRS (n=20) patients. Epigenetic alterations or UPD were detected in 83% of BWS and 50% of SRS individuals by MS-MLPA, but the detection rate increased to 95% of BWS and 70% of SRS by MS pyrosequencing. Thirteen BWS patients (72%) harbored loss-of-methylation (LOM) at LIT1-DMR and two patients (11%) harbored gain-of-methylation (GOM) at H19-DMR, whereas two patients (11%) had both LOM at LIT1-DMR and GOM at H19-DMR, reflecting paternal UPD 11. Thirteen SRS patients (65%) harbored LOM at H19-DMR, whereas one patient (5%) had GOM at SGCE-DMR, reflecting maternal UPD 7. Birth anthropometric profiles were significantly correlated to methylation scores at either H19-DMR or LIT1-DMR. In conclusion, MS pyrosequencing enhanced the detection rate of molecular defects in BWS and SRS. Moreover, it indicates that methylation status at 11p15.5 might have an important role in fetal growth.

AB  - In cases of sexual assault, the evidence often exists as a mixture of female and male body fluids, and in many cases, contains a higher proportion of female body fluids than males. In these cases, Y-STR, rather than autosomal STRs, can provide useful information. It becomes very difficult to identify the true suspect if there is no match among known suspects or if a match exists for two or more suspects, e.g. two suspects from the same paternal lineage. However, age prediction using the DNA methylation of Y-chromosomal CpGs can help narrow the search for unknown suspects and discriminate between older and younger suspects. Therefore, the DNA methylation profiles of semen samples from 56 healthy Korean males were generated using Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array. Among the ten identified age-associated CpG markers located in the Y-chromosome, nine were used to construct age prediction models. The identified markers were further investigated in the MPS analysis of 147 semen samples, and the multiplex assay was validated with the reliability, reproducibility and sensitivity tests. Several age prediction models were constructed using the MPS data with the multiple linear regression, stepwise linear regression, ridge linear regression, lasso regression, elastic net linear regression and support vector machine analyses, and all showed MAEs of 5 to 7 years in the test set samples. Six single-source female samples were also subjected to MPS analysis but showed very low coverage that could not affect the analysis of the mixed samples. Therefore, the age prediction models of the present study are expected to provide useful investigative leads, especially in mixed male and female samples from sexual assault cases.

AB  - Background: Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a high-throughput technique for profiling genome-wide DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution. However, the applications of WGBS are limited by low accuracy resulting from bisulfite-induced damage on DNA fragments. Although many computer programs have been developed for accurate detecting, most of the programs have barely succeeded in improving either quantity or quality of the methylation results. To improve both, we attempted to develop a novel integration of most widely used bisulfite-read mappers: Bismark, BSMAP, and BS-seeker2. Results: A comprehensive analysis of the three mappers revealed that the mapping results of the mappers were mutually complementary under diverse read conditions. Therefore, we sought to integrate the characteristics of the mappers by scoring them to gain robustness against artifacts. As a result, the integration significantly increased detection accuracy compared with the individual mappers. In addition, the amount of detected cytosine was higher than that by Bismark. Furthermore, the integration successfully reduced the fluctuation of detection accuracy induced by read conditions. We applied the integration to real WGBS samples and succeeded in classifying the samples according to the originated tissues by both CpG and CpH methylation patterns. Conclusions: In this study, we improved both quality and quantity of methylation results from WGBS data by integrating the mapping results of three bisulfite-read mappers. Also, we succeeded in combining and comparing WGBS samples by reducing the effects of read heterogeneity on methylation detection. This study contributes to DNA methylation researches by improving efficiency of methylation detection from WGBS data and facilitating the comprehensive analysis of public WGBS data.

AB  - Background: Equal dosage of X-linked genes between males and females is maintained by the X-inactivation of the second X chromosome in females through epigenetic mechanisms. Boys with aneuploidy of the X chromosome exhibit a host of symptoms such as low fertility, musculoskeletal anomalies, and cognitive and behavioral deficits that are presumed to be caused by the abnormal dosage of these genes. The objective of this pilot study is to assess the relationship between CpG methylation, an epigenetic modification, at several genes on the X chromosome and behavioral dysfunction in boys with supernumerary X chromosomes. Results: Two parental questionnaires, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), were analyzed, and they showed expected differences in both internal and external behaviors between neurotypical (46,XY) boys and boys with 49,XXXXY. There were several CpGs in AR and MAOA of boys with 49,XXXXY whose methylation levels were skewed from levels predicted from having one active (Xa) and three inactive (Xi) X chromosomes. Further, methylation levels of multiple CpGs in MAOA showed nominally significant association with externalizing behavior on the CBCL, and the methylation level of one CpG in AR showed nominally significant association with the BRIEF Regulation Index. Conclusions: Boys with 49,XXXXY displayed higher levels of CpG methylation at regulatory intronic regions in X-linked genes encoding the androgen receptor (AR) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), compared to that in boys with 47,XXY and neurotypical boys. Our pilot study results suggest a link between CpG methylation levels and behavior in boys with 49,XXXXY.

AB  - Germline pathogenic variants in two genes encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase genes SETD1A and SETD2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) characterized by developmental delay and congenital anomalies. The SETD1A and SETD2 gene products play a critical role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Specific methylation episignatures have been detected for a range of chromatin gene-related NDDs and have impacted clinical practice by improving the interpretation of variant pathogenicity. To investigate if SETD1A and/or SETD2-related NDDs are associated with a detectable episignature, we undertook targeted genome-wide methylation profiling of > 2 M CpGs using a next-generation sequencing-based assay. A comparison of methylation profiles in patients with SETD1A variants (n = 6) did not reveal evidence of a strong methylation episignature. A review of the clinical and genetic features of the SETD2 patient group revealed that, as reported previously, there were phenotypic differences between patients with truncating mutations (n = 4, Luscan-Lumish syndrome; MIM:616831) and those with missense codon 1740 variants [p.Arg1740Trp (n = 4) and p.Arg1740Gln (n = 2)]. Both SETD2 subgroups demonstrated a methylation episignature, which was characterized by hypomethylation and hypermethylation events, respectively. Within the codon 1740 subgroup, both the methylation changes and clinical phenotype were more severe in those with p.Arg1740Trp variants. We also noted that two of 10 cases with a SETD2NDD had developed a neoplasm. These findings reveal novel epigenotype–genotype–phenotype correlations in SETD2-NDDs and predict a gain-of-function mechanism for SETD2 codon 1740 pathogenic variants.

AB  - HNRNPU encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays critical roles in regulating pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Aberrant expression and dysregulation of HNRNPU have been implicated in various human diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. We applied a next generation sequencing based assay (EPIC-NGS) to investigate genome-wide methylation profiling for >2 M CpGs for 7 individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with HNRNPU germline pathogenic loss-of-function variants. Compared to healthy individuals, 227 HNRNPU-associated differentially methylated positions were detected. Both hyper- and hypomethylation alterations were identified but the former predominated. The identification of a methylation episignature for HNRNPU-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) implicates HNPRNPU-related chromatin alterations in the aetiopathogenesis of this disorder and suggests that episignature profiling should have clinical utility as a predictor for the pathogenicity of HNRNPU variants of uncertain significance. The detection of a methylation episignaure for HNRNPU-associated NDD is consistent with a recent report of a methylation episignature for HNRNPK-associated NDD.

AB  - Aim & methods: To investigate peripheral blood methylation episignatures in KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT-KMT2B), the authors undertook genome-wide methylation profiling of ~2 M CpGs using a next-generation sequencing-based assay and compared the findings with those in controls and patients with KMT2D-related Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1). Results: A total of 1812 significantly differentially methylated CpG positions (false discovery rate < 0.05) were detected in DYT-KMT2B samples compared with controls. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis showed that the 10 DYT-KMT2B samples clustered together and separately from 29 controls and 10 with pathogenic variants in KMT2D. The authors found that most differentially methylated CpG positions were specific to one disorder and that all (DYT-KMT2B) and most (Kabuki syndrome type 1) methylation alterations in CpG islands were gain of methylation events. Conclusion: Using sensitive methylation profiling methodology, the authors replicated recent reports of a methylation episignature for DYT-KMT2B. These findings will facilitate the development of episignature-based assays to improve diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer, and children are a priority group for reducing UV exposure. We evaluated whether an interactive educational activity using handheld dosimeters improved UV-related knowledge among primary (elementary) school students. We conducted an uncontrolled before-after study among 427 students in grades 3–6 (ages 8–12 years) at five schools in the Greater Sydney region, Australia. Students used UV dosimeters to measure UV exposure, using the UV index scale, at different locations on their school grounds with and without different forms of sun protection, followed by an indoor classroom presentation and discussion. A 10-point anonymous questionnaire was completed by each student before and after the entire session (60–90 min). Before-after responses were compared using a generalised linear mixed model, adjusted for school, grade and gender. Overall, the mean raw scores increased from 6.3 (out of 10) before the intervention to 8.9 after the intervention, and the adjusted difference in scores was 2.6 points (95% confidence interval 2.4–2.8; p < 0.0001). Knowledge improved for all questions, with the greatest improvement for questions related to the UV Index (p < 0.05). The effect of the intervention was similar across different school, grade and gender groups. School and grade had no significant effect on mean survey scores, but girls scored an average 0.2 points higher than boys (95% confidence interval 0.1–0.4; p = 0.01). In conclusion, Australian primary school students had moderate knowledge about UV and sun protection, and knowledge improved significantly after a short interactive educational activity using handheld UV dosimeters.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Common obesity is widely regarded as a complex, multifactorial trait influenced by the 'obesogenic' environment, sedentary behavior, and genetic susceptibility contributed by common and rare genetic variants. This review describes the recent advances in understanding the role of genetics in obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: New susceptibility loci and genetic variants are being uncovered, but the collective effect is relatively small and could not explain most of the BMI heritability. Yet-to-be identified common and rare variants, epistasis, and heritable epigenetic changes may account for part of the 'missing heritability'. Evidence is emerging about the role of epigenetics in determining obesity susceptibility, mediating developmental plasticity, which confers obesity risk from early life experiences. Genetic prediction scores derived from selected genetic variants, and also differential DNA methylation levels and methylation scores, have been shown to correlate with measures of obesity and response to weight loss intervention. Genetic variants, which confer susceptibility to obesity-related morbidities like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, were also discovered recently. SUMMARY: We can expect discovery of more rare genetic variants with the advent of whole exome and genome sequencing, and also greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by which environment influences genetic expression and which mediate the gene-environment interaction.

AB  - Background: Leptin (LEP) is a hormone central for energy homeostasis and has been implicated in neurodevelopment. This adipokine is produced by the placenta and is epigenetically regulated by promoter DNA methylation. Recent evidence has suggested a role for LEP in behavioral development. In this study, we investigated associations between profiles of human newborn neurobehavior and placental LEP DNA methylation. Methods: We determined LEP promoter methylation in 444 placental samples from healthy term infants and measured LEP gene expression in a random subset of these samples. Infant neurobehavior was assessed with the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) and we examined the relationship between LEP promoter methylation and profiles of infant neurobehavior derived from these scores generated using a hierarchical model-based clustering method. Results: LEP methylation is negatively correlated with gene expression only in placentas from male infants (r=-0.6, P=. 0.006). A 10% increase in LEP DNA methylation was associated with membership in a profile of infant neurobehavior marked by increased lethargy and hypotonicity (OR. =. 1.9; 95% CI: 1.07-3.4), and consistently with reduced risk of membership in a profile characterized by decreased lethargy and hypotonicity (OR. =. 0.54; 95% CI: 0.3-0.94) only in male infants (n=. 223). No statistically significant associations were observed amongst female infants. Discussion: These results suggest that increased placental LEP DNA methylation, related to reduced expression, may play a role in human newborn neurodevelopment, particularly in reactivity to various stimuli, but that these effects may be sexually dimorphic. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gene mutations occur with high frequency in children with mental retardation. Standard diagnostic methods, such as TMS, Sanger’s sequencing of individual genes, MLPA analysis of deletions, and investigation of methylation status in Martin-Bell syndrome are not informative in the majority of cases that hampered further diagnostic efforts. Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) allowed physicians to continue diagnostic search in previously undiagnosed cases and to find molecular causes of disease. MPS permits to discover a large number of new genes and understand the pathogenesis of mental retardation and brain development more deeply. It became possible to perform prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostics. However, big data generate big problems with their interpretation the genetic counselor faces with. This review reflects the advantages and disadvantages of MPS. Different variants of MPS, including gene panels, whole exome and whole genome sequencing as well as sequencing of trios, are described. In addition, the authors discuss the difficulties of interpretation of the results and recommendations for obtaining the most accurate results.

AB  - TET3 encodes an essential dioxygenase involved in epigenetic regulation through DNA demethylation. TET3 deficiency, or Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS; MIM: 618798), is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder of the DNA demethylation machinery with a nonspecific phenotype resembling other chromatin-modifying disorders, but inconsistent variant types and inheritance patterns pose diagnostic challenges. Given TET3’s direct role in regulating 5-methylcytosine and recent identification of syndrome-specific DNA methylation profiles, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood of TET3-deficient individuals and identified an episignature that distinguishes affected and unaffected individuals and those with mono-allelic and bi-allelic pathogenic variants. Validation and testing of the episignature correctly categorized known TET3 variants and determined pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. Clinical utility was demonstrated when the episignature alone identified an affected individual from over 1000 undiagnosed cases and was confirmed upon distinguishing TET3-deficient individuals from those with 46 other disorders. The TET3-deficient signature - and the signature resulting from activating mutations in DNMT1 which normally opposes TET3 - are characterized by hypermethylation, which for BEFAHRS involves CpG sites that may be biologically relevant. This work expands the role of epi-phenotyping in molecular diagnosis and reveals genome-wide DNA methylation profiling as a quantitative, functional readout for characterization of this new biochemical category of disease.

AB  - Summary Overlapping clinical phenotypes and an expanding breadth and complexity of genomic associations are a growing challenge in the diagnosis and clinical management of Mendelian disorders. The functional consequences and clinical impacts of genomic variation may involve unique, disorder-specific, genomic DNA methylation episignatures. In this study, we describe 19 novel episignature disorders and compare the findings alongside 38 previously established episignatures for a total of 57 episignatures associated with 65 genetic syndromes. We demonstrate increasing resolution and specificity ranging from protein complex, gene, sub-gene, protein domain, and even single nucleotide-level Mendelian episignatures. We show the power of multiclass modeling to develop highly accurate and disease-specific diagnostic classifiers. This study significantly expands the number and spectrum of disorders with detectable DNA methylation episignatures, improves the clinical diagnostic capabilities through the resolution of unsolved cases and the reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance, and provides further insight into the molecular etiology of Mendelian conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three DNA methylation (DNAm) based algorithms, DNAm PhenoAge acceleration (AgeAccelPheno), DNAm GrimAge acceleration (AgeAccelGrim), and mortality risk score (MRscore), based on methylation in 513, 1030, and 10 CpGs, respectively, were established to predict health outcomes and mortality. We aimed to compare and validate the predictive ability of these scores and frailty in relation to mortality in a population-based cohort from Germany. METHODS: DNA methylation in whole blood was measured by the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit (EPIC, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in two random subsets of the ESTHER cohort study (n = 741 and n = 1030). AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and a revised MRscore to adapt EPIC, the MRscore with 8 CpGs (MRscore-8CpGs), were calculated. Frailty was assessed by a frailty index (FI). FINDINGS: During 17 years of follow-up, 458 deaths were observed. All DNAm algorithms and FI were positively correlated with each other. AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, MRscore, and FI showed independent associations with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (95% CI) per SD increase = 1.32 (1.19-1.46), 1.47 (1.32-1.64), 1.73 (1.49-2.01), and 1.31 (1.20-1.43), respectively]. Harrell's C-statistic was 0.710 for a model predicting mortality by age, sex, and leukocyte composition and increased to 0.759 in a model including MRscore-8CpGs and FI. The predictive performance was further improved (Harrell's C-statistic = 0.766) when additionally including AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim into the model. INTERPRETATION: The combination of a DNA methylation score based on 8 CpGs only and an easy to ascertain frailty index may strongly enhance mortality prediction beyond age and sex. FUNDING: The ESTHER study was funded by grants from the Baden-Wurttemberg state Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (Stuttgart, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Berlin, Germany), and the Saarland State Ministry of Health, Social Affairs, Women and the Family (Saarbrucken, Germany).

AB  - Background: Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS; OMIM #180860) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous imprinting disorder characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth failure. The aim of this study was to identify the epigenotype-phenotype correlations in these patients using quantitative DNA methylation analysis. Methods: One hundred and eighty-three subjects clinically suspected of having SRS were referred for diagnostic testing by the methylation profiling of H19-associated imprinting center (IC) 1 and imprinted PEG1/MEST regions using methylation-specific high-resolution melting analysis and methylation quantification with the MassARRAY assay. Correlations between quantitative DNA methylation status and clinical manifestations of the subjects according to the Netchine-Harbison (N-H) clinical scoring system for SRS were analyzed. Results: Among the 183 subjects, 90 had a clinical diagnosis of SRS [N-H score ≥ 4 (maximum = 6)] and 93 had an SRS score < 4. Molecular lesions were detected in 41% (37/90) of the subjects with a clinical diagnosis of SRS, compared with 3% (3/93) of those with an N-H score < 4. The IC1 methylation level was negatively correlated with the N-H score. The molecular diagnosis rate was positively correlated with the N-H score. Thirty-one subjects had IC1 hypomethylation (IC1 methylation level <35% by the MassARRAY assay), seven had maternal uniparental disomy 7, and two had pathogenic copy number variants. Among the 90 subjects with an N-H score ≥ 4, the IC1 methylation level was significantly different between those with or without some clinical SRS features, including birth length ≤ 10th centile, relative macrocephaly at birth, normal cognitive development, body asymmetry, clinodactyly of the fifth finger, and genital abnormalities. Conclusions: This study confirmed the suitability of the N-H clinical scoring system as clinical diagnostic criteria for SRS. Quantitative DNA methylation analysis using the MassARRAY assay can improve the detection of epigenotype‐phenotype correlations, further promoting better genetic counseling and multidisciplinary management for these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rare variants in epigenes (a.k.a. chromatin modifiers), a class of genes that control epigenetic regulation, are commonly identified in both pediatric neurodevelopmental syndromes and as somatic variants in cancer. However, little is known about the extent of the shared disruption of signaling pathways by the same epigene across different diseases. To address this, we study an epigene, Additional Sex Combs-like 1 (ASXL1), where truncating heterozygous variants cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS, OMIM #605039), a germline neurodevelopmental disorder, while somatic variants are driver events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). No BOS patients have been reported to have AML. METHODS: This study explores common pathways dysregulated by ASXL1 variants in patients with BOS and AML. We analyzed whole blood transcriptomic and DNA methylation data from patients with BOS and AML with ASXL1-variant (AML-ASXL1) and examined differential exon usage and cell proportions. RESULTS: Our analyses identified common molecular signatures between BOS and AML-ASXL1 and highlighted key biomarkers, including VANGL2, GRIK5 and GREM2, that are dysregulated across samples with ASXL1 variants, regardless of disease type. Notably, our data revealed significant de-repression of posterior homeobox A (HOXA) genes and upregulation of Wnt-signaling and hematopoietic regulator HOXB4. While we discovered many shared epigenetic and transcriptomic features, we also identified differential splice isoforms in RUNX3 where the long isoform, p46, is preferentially expressed in BOS, while the shorter p44 isoform is expressed in AML-ASXL1. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the strong effects of ASXL1 variants that supersede cell-type and even disease states. This is the first direct comparison of transcriptomic and methylation profiles driven by pathogenic variants in a chromatin modifier gene in distinct diseases. Similar to RASopathies, in which pathogenic variants in many genes lead to overlapping phenotypes that can be treated by inhibiting a common pathway, our data identifies common pathways for ASXL1 variants that can be targeted for both disease states. Comparative approaches of high-penetrance genetic variants across cell types and disease states can identify targetable pathways to treat multiple diseases. Finally, our work highlights the connections of epigenes, such as ASXL1, to an underlying stem-cell state in both early development and in malignancy.

AB  - Background. Increasing evidence has shown that tumorigenesis correlates with aberrant epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, RNA m6A modification, RNA binding proteins, and transcription factors. However, it is unclear that how epigenetic genes linked with alteration contribute to osteosarcoma's incidence and clinical prognosis. We developed an epigenetic modification-related prognostic model that may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma. Methods. We investigated the epigenetic modification-associated genes and their clinical significance in osteosarcoma in this research. Our gene transcriptome data were obtained from the TARGET database and the GEO database. Bioinformatics techniques were used to investigate their functionalities. The diagnostic and prognostic models were constructed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. In addition, we developed a nomogram indicating the practicability of the prognostic model described above. Results. A risk score model constructed based on four epigenetic modification-related genes (MYC, TERT, EIF4E3, and RBM34) can effectively predict the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma. Based on the risk score and clinical features, we constructed a nomogram. Conclusion. Epigenetic modification-related genes have been identified as important prognostic markers that may assist in osteosarcoma therapy therapeutic decision-making.

AB  - The group of CNS mesenchymal (non-meningothelial) and primary glial/neuronal tumors in association with EWSR1-non-ETS rearrangements comprises a growing spectrum of entities, mostly reported in isolation with incomplete molecular profiling. Archival files from three pediatric institutions were queried for unusual cases of pediatric (<=21 years) CNS EWSR1-rearranged tumors confirmed by at least one molecular technique. Extra-axial tumors and cases with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1-ETS family fusions) were excluded. Additional studies, including anchored multiplex-PCR with next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, were performed as needed to determine fusion partner status and brain tumor methylation class, respectively. Five cases (median 17 years) were identified (M:F of 3:2). Location was parenchymal (n = 3) and undetermined (n = 2) with topographic distributions including posterior fossa (n = 1), frontal (n = 1), temporal (n = 1), parietal (n = 1) and occipital (n = 1) lobes. Final designation with fusion findings included desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWSR1-WT1; n = 1) and tumors of uncertain histogenesis (EWSR1-CREM, n = 1; EWSR1-CREB1, n = 1; EWSR1-PLAGL1, n = 1; and EWSR1-PATZ1, n = 1). Tumors showed a wide spectrum of morphology and biologic behavior. For EWSR1-CREM, EWSR1-PLAGL1 and EWSR1-PATZ1 tumors, no significant methylation scores were reached in the known brain tumor classes. Available outcome (4/5) was reported as favorable (n = 2) and unfavorable (n = 2) with a median follow-up of 30 months. In conclusion, we describe five primary EWSR1-non-ETS fused CNS tumors exhibiting morphologic and biologic heterogeneity and we highlight the clinical importance of determining specific fusion partners to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment and monitoring. Larger prospective clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of histotypes, anatomical location, fusion partners, breakpoints and methylation profiles in patients with these rare tumors.

AB  - Introduction: The oxygen load provided to preterm infants during postnatal stabilization caused significant modifications of DNA methylation in the preterm epigenome. We aimed to assess if there was an association between DNA methylation changes and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: Preterm infants were followed until 2 years after birth. Dried blood spots were processed, and DNA methylation was measured using the MassARRAY technology of Sequenom. We selected specific genes that corresponded to differentially methylated CpG sites that correlated with the oxygen load at 2 h after birth. Neurodevelopmental outcome was blindly assessed using Bayley-III scale. Results: Of 32 eligible patients, we completed the methylation analysis in 19 patients and the neurodevelopmental evaluation in 22. Comparison of differential methylation analysis between time 0 (cord blood) and 2 h after birth showed 74 significant CpGs, out of which 14 correlated with the oxygen load received at birth. Out of these 14 genes, only TRAPPC9 showed statistically significant differences at 2 years of age between the infants who received >500 mL versus <500 mL O2/kg. Premature who received >500 mL O2/kg showed significantly lower motor composite scores. Discussion/Conclusions: Premature who received higher oxygen load scored lower motor composite scores and showed a hypermethylation pattern of TRAPPC9 at 2 years of age. TRAPPC9 mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability, so changes in the CpG methylation of this gene and its subsequent expression alteration can produce a similar phenotype. Further studies with a greater sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the inflammation-associated cancers. Helicobacter pylori is now thought to be responsible for more than 95% of all GCs, and its development is associated with at least four mechanisms that lead to genetic instability of the gastric mucosa. The risk of developing GC can be predicted by assessing the extent and severity of corpus atrophy and the degree of risk can be estimated by using non-invasive methods such as the pepsinogen test, or endoscopic or histological cancer risk scoring systems such as the operative link for gastritis assessment. The eradication of H.pylori will stop the progression of gastritis, prevent atrophy and thus decrease the risk of cancer. H.pylori eradication should follow the dictum "use what works best locally". There are several new developments in the diagnosis and treatment of H.pylori infection including serological antibody, fluorescent in situ hybridization and antibiotic resistance tests. It is still necessary to develop a preventive or therapeutic vaccine to prevent GC. © 2013 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and molecular features, genotype-phenotype correlation and the efficacy of different diagnostic criteria for predicting a positive molecular test in Chinese Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) patients. A retrospective tertiary-wide study was performed in Hong Kong with 27 molecularly confirmed BWS patients between January 2010 and September 2015. It was observed that 48.1% of the BWS cases were caused by loss of methylation at differentially methylated region 2 (DMR2-LoM) of the 11p15.5 region, 11.1% by gain of methylation at differentially methylated region 1 (DMR1-GoM) of the 11p15.5 region, 33.3% by paternal uniparental disomy 11 [upd (11)pat] and 7.5% by CDKN1C mutation. Two out of 27 (7.4%) had embryonal tumors. Both belonged to the DMR1-GoM subtype with one Wilm's tumor diagnosed at 3 months of age and the other, hepatoblastoma, diagnosed at 6 months of age. However, no genotype-phenotype correlation can be concluded by this cohort study. Finally, for different clinical diagnostic criteria, the Debaun and Tucker criteria and the Ibrahim et al. weighing score system have the best performance for predicting a positive molecular test in our Chinese BWS cohort. It is the largest study of molecularly confirmed BWS in the Chinese. Their clinical and epigenetic features are comparable with other ethnic populations.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms, (epi)genotype-phenotype correlation, and the performance of the three clinical scoring systems—namely Netchine et al, Bartholdi et al, and Birmingham scores—for patients with Silver-Russell syndrome in Hong Kong. Methods: This retrospective case series was conducted at two tertiary genetic clinics, the Clinical Genetic Service, Department of Health, and clinical genetic clinic in Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. All records of patients with suspected Silver-Russell syndrome under the care of the two genetic clinics between January 2010 and September 2015 were retrieved from the computer database. Results: Of the 28 live-birth patients with Silver-Russell syndrome, 35.7% had H19 loss of DNA methylation, 21.4% had maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, 3.6% had mosaic maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 11, and the remaining 39.3% were Silver-Russell syndrome of unexplained molecular origin. No significant correlation between (epi)genotype and phenotype could be identified between H19 loss of DNA methylation and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. Comparison of molecularly confirmed patients and patients with Silver-Russell syndrome of unexplained origin revealed that postnatal microcephaly and café-au-lait spots were more common in the latter group, and body and limb asymmetry was more common in the former group. Performance analysis showed the Netchine et al and Birmingham scoring systems had similar sensitivity in identifying Hong Kong Chinese subjects with Silver-Russell syndrome. Conclusion: This is the first territory-wide study of Silver-Russell syndrome in Hong Kong. The clinical features and the spectrum of underlying epigenetic defects were comparable to those reported in western populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) enlargement has been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia; yet, what biological factors shape LVV during early development remain unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for neurodevelopment that is altered in schizophrenia, is a key molecular system of interest. METHODS: In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm in cord blood with LVV in childhood (measured using T1-weighted brain scans at 10 years), based on data from a large population-based birth cohort, the Generation R Study (N = 840). Employing both probe-level and methylation profile score (MPS) approaches, we further examined whether epigenetic modifications identified at birth in cord blood are: (a) also observed cross-sectionally in childhood using peripheral blood DNAm at age of 10 years (Generation R, N = 370) and (b) prospectively associated with LVV measured in young adulthood in an all-male sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 114). RESULTS: At birth, DNAm levels at four CpGs (annotated to potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, KCTD3; SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator, SDCCAG8; glutaredoxin, GLRX) prospectively associated with childhood LVV after genome-wide correction; these genes have been implicated in brain development and psychiatric traits including schizophrenia. An MPS capturing a broader epigenetic profile of LVV - but not individual top hits - showed significant cross-sectional associations with LVV in childhood in Generation R and prospectively associated with LVV in early adulthood within ALSPAC. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds suggestive evidence that DNAm at birth prospectively associates with LVV at different life stages, albeit with small effect sizes. The prediction of MPS on LVV in a childhood sample and an independent male adult sample further underscores the stability and reproducibility of DNAm as a potential marker for LVV. Future studies with larger samples and comparable time points across development are needed to further elucidate how DNAm associates with this clinically relevant brain structure and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, and what factors explain the identified DNAm profile of LVV at birth.

AB  - Background: Prenatal mercury (Hg) exposure is associated with adverse child neurobehavioral outcomes. Because Hg can interfere with placental functioning and cross the placenta to target the fetal brain, prenatal Hg exposure can inhibit fetal growth and development directly and indirectly. oBjectives: We examined potential associations between prenatal Hg exposure assessed through infant toenail Hg, placental DNA methylation changes, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: The methylation status of > 485,000 CpG loci was interrogated in 192 placental samples using Illumina’s Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. Hg concentrations were analyzed in toenail clippings from a subset of 41 infants; neurobehavior was assessed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) in an independent subset of 151 infants. results: We identified 339 loci with an average methylation diference > 0.125 between any two toenail Hg tertiles. Variation among these loci was subsequently found to be associated with a high-risk neurodevelopmental profle (omnibus p-value = 0.007) characterized by the NNNS. Ten loci had p < 0.01 for the association between methylation and the high-risk NNNS profle. Six of 10 loci reside in the EMID2 gene and were hypomethylated in the 16 high-risk profle infants’ placentas. Methylation at these loci was moderately correlated (correlation coefficients range, –0.33 to –0.45) with EMID2 expression. conclusions: EMID2 hypomethylation may represent a novel mechanism linking in utero Hg exposure and adverse infant neurobehavioral outcomes.

AB  - Partial duplications of genes can be challenging to detect and interpret and, therefore, likely represent an underreported cause of human disease. X-linked dominant variants in ATRX are associated with Alpha-thalassemia/impaired intellectual development syndrome, X-linked (ATR-X syndrome), a clinically heterogeneous disease generally presenting with intellectual disability, hypotonia, characteristic facies, genital anomalies, and alpha-thalassemia. We describe an affected male with a de novo hemizygous intragenic duplication of ~43.6 kb in ATRX, detected by research genome sequencing following non-diagnostic clinical testing. RNA sequencing and DNA methylation episignature analyses were central in variant interpretation, and this duplication was subsequently interpreted as disease-causing. This represents the smallest reported tandem duplication within ATRX associated with disease. This case demonstrates the diagnostic utility of integrating multiple omics technologies, which can ultimately lead to a definitive diagnosis for rare disease patients.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment (CM) is an established major risk factor for a number of negative health outcomes later in life. While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures. This study highlights the importance of mapping not only of the epigenome but also the exposome and extending the observational timeframe to well before birth. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background International literature has underlined the complex interplay between genetic and environmental variables in shaping children's emotional-behavioral functioning. Objective This study aimed to explore the dynamic relationship between children's Dopamine Transporter (DAT1) genotype and methylation, and maternal and paternal affective environment, on children's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) problems and dysregulation problems. Method In a community sample of 76 families with school-aged children, we assessed children's DAT1 genotype and methylation, their own ADHD problems and dysregulation profile (CBCL 6-18 DP), and maternal and paternal psychopathological risk, parenting stress, and marital adjustment. Hierarchical regressions were carried out to verify the possible moderation of children's genotype on the relationship between children's methylation and psychopathological risk, parental environment and children's methylation, and parental environment and children's psychopathological risk. Results The levels of methylation at M1 CpG significantly predicted ADHD problems among children with 10/10 genotype, whereas high levels of methylation at M6 CpG predicted low ADHD problems for children with 9/x genotype. High levels of methylation at M3 CpG were associated with high scores of CBCL DP. DAT1 genotype moderated the relationship between maternal and paternal variables with children's methylation and psychopathological risk. The scores of maternal and paternal Dyadic Adjustment Scale showed indirect effects on children's methylation and psychopathological risk in relation to those exerted by risk factors. Conclusion Our study has supported the emerging evidence on the complex nature of children's emotional-behavioral functioning and the associated risk and protective factors, with important implications for the planning of preventive programs.

AB  - A significant number of advances have been made in the last 5 years with respect to the identification, diagnosis, assessment, and management of infants with prenatal opioid exposure and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) from birth to early childhood. The primary objective of this review is to summarize major advances that will inform the clinical management of opioid-exposed newborns and provide an overview of NOWS care to promote the implementation of best practices. First, advances with respect to standardizing the clinical diagnosis of NOWS will be reviewed. Second, the most commonly used assessment strategies are discussed, with a focus on presenting new quality improvement and clinical trial data surrounding the use of the new function-based assessment Eat, Sleep, and Console approach. Third, both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment modalities are reviewed, highlighting clinical trials that have compared the use of higher calorie and low lactose formula, vibrating crib mattresses, morphine compared with methadone, buprenorphine compared with morphine or methadone, the use of ondansetron as a medication to prevent the need for NOWS opioid pharmacologic treatment, and the introduction of symptom-triggered dosing compared with scheduled dosing. Fourth, maternal, infant, environmental, and genetic factors that have been found to be associated with NOWS severity are highlighted. Finally, emerging recommendations on postdelivery hospitalization follow-up and developmental surveillance are presented, along with highlighting ongoing and needed areas of research to promote infant and family well-being for families impacted by opioid use.

AB  - Introduction: Mutations of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene correlate mainly with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but can occasionally be pathogenic for medulloblastoma (MBL) wingless-related integration site (WNT) subtype, the course of which has only recently been described. Methods: We retrieved all patients with documented germline APC mutations and a diagnosis of MBL to examine their outcome, late effects of treatment, and further oncological events. Results: Between 2007 and 2016, we treated six patients, all with a pathogenic APC variant mutation and all with MBL, classic histotype. None had metastatic disease. All patients were in complete remission a median 65 months after treatment with craniospinal irradiation at 23.4 Gy, plus a boost on the posterior fossa/tumor bed up to 54 Gy, followed by cisplatin/carboplatin, lomustine, and vincristine for a maximum of eight courses. Five of six diagnostic revised MRI were suggestive of the WNT molecular subgroup typical aspects. Methylation profile score (in two cases) and copy number variation analysis (chromosome 6 deletion in two cases) performed on four of six retrieved samples confirmed WNT molecular subgroup. Four out of six patients had a positive family history of FAP, while gastrointestinal symptoms prompted its identification in the other two cases. Four patients developed other tumors (desmoid, MELTUMP, melanoma, pancreatoblastoma, thyroid Tir3) from 5 to 7 years after MBL. Discussion: Our data confirm a good prognosis for patients with MBL associated with FAP. Patients’ secondary tumors may or may not be related to their syndrome or treatment, but warrant adequate attention when planning shared guidelines for these patients.

AB  - Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is caused by deletion of a critical region of the short arm of chromosome 4. Clinical features of WHS include distinct dysmorphic facial features, growth restriction, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other malformations. The NSD2 gene localizes within this critical region along with several other genes. Pathogenic variants in NSD2 cause Rauch-Steindl (RAUST) syndrome. Clinical features of RAUST syndrome partially overlap with WHS, however epilepsy and the recognizable facial gestalt are not observed. Here, we report a case of a young boy who presented with developmental delay, dysmorphic features and short stature. After negative chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing, genomic DNA methylation episignature analysis was performed. Episignatures are sensitive and specific genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with a growing number of rare disorders. The patient was positive for the WHS episignature. Reanalysis of the patient's exome data identified a previously undetected frameshift variant in NSD2, leading to a diagnosis of RAUST. This report demonstrates the clinical utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for unresolved patients, and provides insight into the overlapping pathology between WHS and RAUST as demonstrated by the similarities in their genomic DNA methylation profiles.

AB  - Background: Epigenetic scores (EpiScores), reflecting DNA methylation (DNAm)-based surrogates for complex traits, have been developed for multiple circulating proteins. EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is over-represented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. Results: 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates |0.14 to 0.88|, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates |0.06 to 0.13|, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). In a preterm sub-group (n=217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. Conclusions: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable and functionally impairing disease. The recognition and intervention of BD especially that characterized by early onset remains challenging. Risk biomarkers for predicting BD transition among at-risk youth may improve disease prognosis. We reviewed the more recent clinical studies to find possible pre-diagnostic biomarkers in youth at familial or (and) clinical risk of BD. Here we found that putative biomarkers for predicting conversion to BD include findings from multiple sample sources based on different hypotheses. Putative risk biomarkers shown by perspective studies are higher bipolar polygenetic risk scores, epigenetic alterations, elevated immune parameters, front-limbic system deficits, and brain circuit dysfunction associated with emotion and reward processing. Future studies need to enhance machine learning integration, make clinical detection methods more objective, and improve the quality of cohort studies. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion mainly occur in adults, display pathological features of glioblastomas (GB) and are usually classified as glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them. METHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score > 0.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (< 40), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (> 40), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated. Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age < 40 and lack of TERT promoter mutation. CONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients' risk.

AB  - Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common pediatric brain tumors and it is estimated that one-third of patients will not achieve long-term survival. Conventional prognostic parameters have limited and unreliable correlations with MB outcome, presenting a major challenge for patients' clinical improvement. Acknowledging this issue, our aim was to build a gene signature and evaluate its potential as a new prognostic model for patients with the disease. In this study, we used six datasets totaling 1679 samples including RNA gene expression and DNA methylation data from primary MB as well as control samples from healthy cerebellum. We identified methylation-driven genes (MDGs) in MB, genes whose expression is correlated with their methylation. We employed LASSO regression, incorporating the MDGs as a parameter to develop the prognostic model. Through this approach, we derived a two-gene signature (GS-2) of candidate prognostic biomarkers for MB (CEMIP and NCBP3). Using a risk score model, we confirmed the GS-2 impact on overall survival (OS) with Kaplan-Meier analysis. We evaluated its robustness and accuracy with receiver operating characteristic curves predicting OS at 1, 3, and 5 years in multiple independent datasets. The GS-2 showed highly significant results as an independent prognostic biomarker compared to traditional MB markers. The methylation-regulated GS-2 risk score model can effectively classify patients with MB into high and low-risk, reinforcing the importance of this epigenetic modification in the disease. Such genes stand out as promising prognostic biomarkers with potential application for MB treatment. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas are a group of diagnostically challenging tumors in the pediatric population. Molecular techniques are instrumental for the categorization and differential diagnosis of these tumors. A subgroup of recently identified soft tissue sarcomas with undifferentiated round cell morphology was characterized by Capicua transcriptional receptor (CIC) rearrangements. Recently, an array‐based DNA methylation analysis of undifferentiated tumors with small blue round cell histology was shown to provide a highly robust and reproducible approach for precisely classifying this diagnostically challenging group of tumors. We describe the case of an undifferentiated sarcoma of the abdominal wall in a 12‐year‐old girl. The patient presented with a voluminous mass of the abdominal wall, and multiple micro‐nodules in the right lung. The tumor was unclassifiable with current immunohistochemical and molecular approaches. However, DNA methylation profiling allowed us to classify this neoplasia as small blue round cell tumor with CIC alterations. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. After 22 months, the patient is disease‐free and in good clinical condition. To put our experience in context, we conducted a literature review, analyzing current knowledge and state‐of‐the‐art diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of CIC rearranged sarcomas. Our findings further support the use of DNA methylation profiling as an important tool to improve diagnosis of non‐Ewing small round cell tumors.

AB  - Dystonia is a prevalent, heterogeneous movement disorder characterized by involuntarily abnormal postures. Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites, which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1× log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (P = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance - thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity. Similarly, it may also function in monitoring the recently envisioned treatment of KMT2B deficiency by inhibition of DNA methylation.

AB  - In recent years, epigenetic markers emerged as a new tool to understand the influence of lifestyle factors on obesity phenotypes. Adolescence is considered an important epigenetic window over a human's lifetime. The objective of this work was to explore baseline changes in DNA methylation that could be associated with a better weight loss response after a multidisciplinary intervention program in Spanish obese or overweight adolescents. Overweight or obese adolescents (n=107) undergoing 10 wk of a multidisciplinary intervention for weight loss were assigned as high or low responders to the treatment. A methylation microarray was performed to search for baseline epigenetic differences between the 2 groups (12 subjects/group), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to validate (n=107) relevant CpG sites and surrounding regions. After validation, 5 regions located in or near AQP9, DUSP22, HIPK3, TNNT1, and TNNI3 genes showed differential methylation levels between high and low responders to the multidisciplinary weight loss intervention. Moreover, a calculated methylation score was significantly associated with changes in weight, BMI-SDS, and body fat mass loss after the treatment. In summary, we have identified 5 DNA regions that are differentially methylated depending on weight loss response. These methylation changes may help to better understand the weight loss response in obese adolescents.

AB  - Kabuki syndrome is a Mendelian disorder of the epigenetic machinery characterized by typical dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, and postnatal growth deficiency. Pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the chromatin modifiers KMT2D and KDM6A are responsible for Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) and Kabuki syndrome 2 (KS2), respectively. In addition, 11 cases of KS1 caused by mosaic variants in KMT2D have been reported in the literature. Some of these individuals display milder craniofacial and growth phenotypes, and most do not have congenital heart defects. We report the case of an infant with severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral atresia and aortic atresia (HLHS MA-AA), pulmonary vein stenosis, and atypical facies with a somatic mosaic de novo nonsense variant in KMT2D (c.8200C>T, p.R2734*) identified on trio exome sequencing of peripheral blood and present in 11.2% of sequencing reads. KS was confirmed with EpiSign, a diagnostic genome-wide DNA methylation platform used to identify epigenetic signatures. This case suggests that use of this newly available clinical test can guide the interpretation of low-level mosaic variants identified through sequencing and suggests a new lower limit of mosaicism in whole blood required for a diagnosis of KS.

AB  - Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell cancer with poor survival, characterized by the clonal expansion of multiple myeloma cells (MMC), primarily in the bone marrow. Novel compounds are currently tested in this disease, but partial or minor patients' responses are observed for most compounds used as a single agent. The design of predictors for drug efficacy could be most useful to better understand basic mechanisms targeted by these drugs and design clinical trials. In the current study, we report the building of a DNA methylation score (DM score) predicting the efficacy of decitabine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), targeting methylation-regulated gene expression. DMscore was built by identifying 47 genes regulated by decitabine in human myeloma cell lines and the expression of which in primary MMCs of previously untreated patients is predictive for overall survival. A high DM score predicts patients' poor survival, and, of major interest, high sensitivity of primary MMCs or human myeloma cell lines to decitabine in vitro. Thus, DMscore could be useful to design novel treatments with DMNT inhibitor in multiple myeloma and has highlighted 47 genes, the gene products of which could be important for multiple myeloma disease development.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is ranked to have high mortality among most malignancies worldwide. In the adult population, the seroprevalence rates of the John Cunningham virus (JCV) range from 70% to 90%. Recently the association for JCV in many malignant tumours have been reported worldwide, including colonic and rectum cancers. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) can promote tumour growth where it is abundant in the tumour microenvironment, and its up-regulation is considered a poor prognostic feature in different types of solid tumours, including colon malignancies. One hundred tissue biopsies belonged to 50 patients with colorectal cancers and 30 benign colonic tumour patients, and 20 colorectal control tissues were enrolled in this study. JCV was detected via chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), while IL-1 beta was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The recorded data showed that 21 out of 50 (42%) tissue samples with colorectal carcinoma showed positive CISH reactions for JCV DNA in this study. The benign colorectal tumours group revealed positive signals in 2 out of 30 tissues representing 6.7% of this group. Lastly, no control tissues showed positive signals for the JCV -CISH test. The positive signals of IL-1 Beta-IHC detection were found in 26 out of 50 (52 %) colorectal carcinoma tissues, while in the benign colorectal tumour was 43.3% (13 out of 30) and in AHC was 20% (4 out of 20 tissues). The high rates of JCV infection in this group of Iraqi patients with colonic adenocarcinoma in concordance with IL-1 Beta expression could play an essential role in the development and progression of these malignant tumours along with benign colonic tumours. To analyze the concordant expression of IL-1 beta gene and JCV in issues from a group of Iraqi patients with colonic adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for most children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Novel therapies controlling the disorder prior to HSCT are needed. We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and antileukemic activity of azacitidine monotherapy prior to HSCT in newly diagnosed JMML patients. Eighteen patients enrolled from September 2015 to November 2017 were treated with azacitidine (75 mg/m2) administered IV once daily on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was the number of patients with clinical complete remission (cCR) or clinical partial remission (cPR) after 3 cycles of therapy. Pharmacokinetics, genome-wide DNA-methylation levels, and variant allele frequencies of leukemia-specific index mutations were also analyzed. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles and 5 patients completed 6 cycles. After 3 cycles, 11 patients (61%) were in cPR and 7 (39%) had progressive disease. Six of 16 patients (38%) who needed platelet transfusions were transfusion-free after 3 cycles. All 7 patients with intermediate- or low-methylation signatures in genome-wide DNA-methylation studies achieved cPR. Seventeen patients received HSCT; 14 (82%) were leukemia-free at a median follow-up of 23.8 months (range, 7.0-39.3 months) after HSCT. Azacitidine was well tolerated and plasma concentration-time profiles were similar to observed profiles in adults. In conclusion, azacitidine monotherapy is a suitable option for children with newly diagnosed JMML. Although long-term safety and efficacy remain to be fully elucidated in this population, these data demonstrate that azacitidine provides valuable clinical benefit to JMML patients prior to HSCT. This trial was registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02447666.

AB  - There is substantial variation between humans in aggressive behavior, with its biological etiology and molecular genetic basis mostly unknown. This review chapter offers an overview of genomic and omics studies revealing the genetic contribution to aggression and first insights into associations with epigenetic and other omics (e.g., metabolomics) profiles. We allowed for a broad phenotype definition including studies on "aggression," "aggressive behavior," or "aggression-related traits," "antisocial behavior," "conduct disorder," and "oppositional defiant disorder." Heritability estimates based on family and twin studies in children and adults of this broadly defined phenotype of aggression are around 50%, with relatively small fluctuations around this estimate. Next, we review the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which search for associations with alleles and also allow for gene-based tests and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) which seek to identify associations with differently methylated regions across the genome. Both GWAS and EWAS allow for construction of Polygenic and DNA methylation scores at an individual level. Currently, these predict a small percentage of variance in aggression. We expect that increases in sample size will lead to additional discoveries in GWAS and EWAS, and that multiomics approaches will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of aggression.

AB  - We examined the performance of methylation scores (MS) and polygenic scores (PGS) for birth weight, BMI, prenatal maternal smoking exposure, and smoking status to assess the extent to which MS could predict these traits and exposures over and above the PGS in a multi-omics prediction model. MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

AB  - DNA methylation classifiers (“episignatures”) help to determine the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD) are prevalent anxiety disorders characterized by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Both disorders share overlapping features and often coexist, despite displaying distinct characteristics. Childhood life adversity, overall stressful life events, and genetic factors contribute to the development of these disorders. DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, we investigated whether whole-genome DNA methylation risk scores (MRSs) for SAD risk, severity of social anxiety, childhood life adversity, PD risk, and overall stressful life events were associated with SAD or PD case-control status. Preliminary epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) for SAD risk, severity of social anxiety, and childhood life adversity were conducted in 66 SAD individuals and 77 healthy controls (HCs). Similarly, EWASs for PD risk and overall stressful life events were performed in 182 PD individuals and 81 HCs. MRSs were calculated from these EWASs. MRSs derived from the EWASs of SAD risk and severity of social anxiety were greater in PD patients than in HCs. Additionally, MRSs derived from the EWASs of overall stressful life events, particularly in PD individuals, were lower in SAD individuals than in HCs. In contrast, MRSs for childhood life adversity or PD risk were not significantly associated with PD or SAD case-control status. These findings highlight the epigenetic features shared in both disorders and the distinctive epigenetic features related to social avoidance in SAD patients, helping to elucidate the epigenetic basis of these disorders.

AB  - Age estimation of unidentified bodies is of marked importance in forensic medicine. In previous studies, the analysis of DNA methylation in body fluids led to the identification of several age-related CpG sites in genes such as EDARADD and FHL2. However, limited information is available on whether interethnic differences may affect the age prediction results. In the present study, we examined the effect of ethnicity on the age prediction method based on methylation scores, which were determined via methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting. We found that there was a significant difference in methylation scores between Japanese and Indonesian participants of early 20 s group, and that the nationality coefficient was significant for age estimation when applying the existing method for the analysis of the methylation status of EDARADD and FHL2. This suggests that when using certain biochemical indicators as a predictor of age, the effects of ethnicity on DNA methylation should be considered to improve the accuracy of the estimation.

AB  - Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) are 2 clinically opposite growth-affecting disorders belonging to the group of congenital imprinting disorders. The expression of both syndromes usually depends on the parental origin of the chromosome in which the imprinted genes reside. SRS is characterized by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation with various additional clinical features such as hemihypertrophy, relative macrocephaly, fifth finger clinodactyly, and triangular facies. BWS is an overgrowth syndrome with many additionalclinical features such as macroglossia, organomegaly, and an increased risk of childhood tumors. Both SRS and BWS are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and for clinical diagnosis, different diagnostic scoring systems have been developed. Six diagnostic scoring systems for SRS and 4 for BWS have been previously published. However, neither syndrome has common consensus diagnostic criteria yet. Most cases of SRS and BWS are associated with oppositeepigenetic or genetic abnormalitiesin the 11p15 chromosomal region leading to opposite imbalances in the expression of imprinted genes. SRS is also caused by maternal uniparental disomy 7, which is usually identified in 5-10% of the cases, and is therefore the first imprinting disorder that affects 2 different chromosomes. In this review, we describe in detail the clinical diagnostic criteria and scoring systems as well as molecular causes in both SRS and BWS.

AB  - Background: The epigenetic effects of transmission of certain regulatory molecules, such as miRNAs, through maternal milk on future generations, are still unknown and have not been fully understood yet. We hypothesized that breastfeeding regularly by adoptive-mother may cause transmission of miRNAs as epigenetic regulating factors to the infant, and the marriage of milk-siblings may cause various pathologies in the future generations. Results: A cross-fostering model using a/a and Avy/a mice had been established. F2 milk-sibling and F2 control groups were obtained from mating of milk-siblings or unrelated mice. Randomized selected animals in the both F2 groups were sacrificed for miRNA expression studies and the remainings were followed for phenotypic changes (coat color, obesity, hyperglycemia, liver pathology, and life span). The lifespan in the F2 milk-sibling group was shorter than the control group (387 vs 590 days, p = 0.011) and they were more obese during the aging period. Histopathological examination of liver tissues revealed abnormal findings in F2 milk-sibling group. In order to understand the epigenetic mechanisms leading to these phenotypic changes, we analyzed miRNA expression differences between offspring of milk-sibling and control matings and focused on the signaling pathways regulating lifespan and metabolism. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with pathways regulating metabolism, survival, and cancer development such as the PI3K-Akt, ErbB, mTOR, and MAPK, insulin signaling pathways. We further analyzed the expression patterns of miR-186-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-345-5p, and miR-34c-5p and their candidate target genes Mapk8, Gsk3b, and Ppargc1a in ovarian and liver tissues. Conclusion: Our findings support for the first time that the factors modifying the epigenetic mechanisms may be transmitted by breast milk and these epigenetic interactions may be transferred transgenerationally. Results also suggested hereditary epigenetic effects of cross-fostering on future generations and the impact of mother-infant dyad on epigenetic programming.

AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous cancer-predisposing disorder representing the most common bone marrow failure syndrome. It is caused by inactivating predominantly biallelic mutations involving >20 genes encoding proteins with roles in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Molecular diagnosis of FA is challenging due to the wide spectrum of the contributing gene mutations and structural rearrangements. The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.

AB  - This study describes monozygotic (MZ) male twins with fragile X syndrome (FXS), mosaic for normal size (NS: <44 CGGs), premutation (PM: 55–199 CGG) and full mutation (FM alleles ≥ 200) alleles, with autism. At 4 years of age chromosomal microarray confirmed monozygosity with both twins showing an XY sex complement. Normal size (30 CGG), PM (99 CGG) and FM (388–1632 CGGs) alleles were detected in Twin 1 (T1) by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot testing, while only PM (99 CGG) and FM (672–1025) alleles were identified in Twin 2 (T2). At ~5 years, T2 had greater intellectual impairments with a full scale IQ (FSIQ) of 55 and verbal IQ (VIQ) of 59, compared to FSIQ of 62 and VIQ of 78 for T1. This was consistent with the quantitative FMR1 methylation testing, revealing 10% higher methylation at 80% for T2; suggesting that less active unmethylated alleles were present in T2 as compared to T1. AmplideX methylation PCR also identified partial methylation, including an unmethylated NS allele in T2, undetected by standard testing. In conclusion, this report demonstrates significant differences in intellectual functioning between the MZ twins mosaic for NS, PM and FM alleles with partial FMR1 promoter methylation.

AB  - The search for aetiology of Mendelian disorders is traditionally based on the observation of clinical phenotypes and molecular screening of associated genes. However, a disease-specific diagnosis can be challenging. In this study we detail how the combinatorial genomic and epigenomic assessment allowed to find the underlying molecular event of a clinical case that remained misdiagnosed for years. The individual was referred as affected by an atypical form of Kabuki syndrome with a variant of uncertain significance in the KMT2D gene. However, significant inconsistencies with this diagnosis emerged upon familial segregation of the variant and after the clinical re-evaluation. Therefore, we applied an epigenomic strategy by studying the DNA methylation profile which resulted not consistent with the Kabuki syndrome episignature or with any other disorder-specific episignature described so far, providing strong evidence that the Kabuki syndrome diagnosis does not apply. This result led us to further investigate for epigenetic machinery diseases by using a multigene panel for chromatinopathies. Since this analysis yielded negative results, we applied a whole exome sequencing and identified a de novo pathogenic variant in the CTNNB1 gene associated to NEDSDV syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies. Based on molecular results and the updated clinical features, we confirmed the NEDSDV diagnosis. Our findings show that the combination of genomic and epigenomics strategies, along with a deeper analysis of clinical phenotype, may provide a significant improvement in the diagnostic protocols for rare genetic disorders and help resolve long-time misdiagnosed and unsolved case.

AB  - The serotonin receptor, HTR 2A, exhibits placental expression and function and can be controlled through DNA methylation. The relationship between methylation of HTR2A in the placenta and neurodevelopmental outcomes, evaluated using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS), was assessed in newborn infants (n = 444). HTR2A methylation was significantly higher in males and marginally higher in infants whose mothers reported tobacco use during pregnancy. Controlling for confounding variables, HTR2A methylation was negatively associated with infant quality of movement (p = 0.05) and positively associated with infant attention (p = 0.0001). These results suggest that methylation of the HTR2A gene can be biologically and environmentally modulated and is associated with key measures of neurodevelopment. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids occur in soils worldwide and are presumed to be produced by soil bacteria. They form the base of the MBT/CBT proxy (methylation of branched tetraethers/cyclisation of branched tetraethers) for palaeoclimate reconstruction. The degree of cyclisation and methylation, expressed in the CBT and MBT indices, has been shown to relate to soil pH, and to both temperature and soil pH, respectively. To evaluate the direct impact of soil pH on the abundance and distribution of branched GDGTs, either present as core lipids or derived from intact polar lipids (IPLs), long term (>45 years) soil pH manipulation plots, with a pH range of 4.5-7.5, were analyzed. The CBT index values of both core and IPL-derived branched GDGTs was significantly (r(2) = 0.93, P = 0.0004 and r(2) = 0.93, P = 0.0005, respectively) linearly related to actual soil pH, confirming the direct influence of pH on the distribution of branched GDGT. In contrast, the MBT index was only influenced to a minor extent by the changes in soil pH. Branched GDGT abundances decreased with increasing soil pH, supporting the idea that Acidobacteria may be a possible source of these orphan membrane lipids. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human aggression is influenced by an interplay between genetic predisposition and experience across the life span. This interaction is thought to occur through epigenetic mechanisms, inducing differential gene expression, thereby moderating neuronal cell and circuit function, and thus shaping aggressive behaviour. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels were measured in peripheral blood obtained from 95 individuals participating in the Estonian Children Personality Behaviours and Health Study (ECPBHS) at 15 and 25 years of age. We examined the association between aggressive behaviour, as measured by Life History of Aggression (LHA) total score and DNAm levels both assessed at age 25. We further examined the pleiotropic effect of genetic variants regulating LHA-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and multiple traits related to aggressive behaviours. Lastly, we tested whether the DNA methylomic loci identified in association with LHA at age 25 were also present at age 15. RESULTS: We found one differentially methylated position (DMP) (cg17815886; p = 1.12 x 10-8 ) and five differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LHA after multiple testing adjustments. The DMP annotated to the PDLIM5 gene, and DMRs resided in the vicinity of four protein-encoding genes (TRIM10, GTF2H4, SLC45A4, B3GALT4) and a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC02068). We observed evidence for the colocalization of genetic variants associated with top DMPs and general cognitive function, educational attainment and cholesterol levels. Notably, a subset of the DMPs associated with LHA at age 25 also displayed altered DNAm patterns at age 15 with high accuracy in predicting aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential role of DNAm in the development of aggressive behaviours. We observed pleiotropic genetic variants associated with identified DMPs, and various traits previously established to be relevant in shaping aggression in humans. The concordance of DNAm signatures in adolescents and young adults may have predictive value for inappropriate and maladaptive aggression later in life. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is thought to cause delayed cardiac damage. DNA methylation-based liquid biopsies are novel biomarkers for monitoring acute cardiac cell death. We assessed cell-free DNA molecules as markers for cardiac damage after open-heart surgery. Novel cardiomyocyte-specific DNA methylation markers were applied to measure cardiac cfDNA in the plasma of 42 infants who underwent open-heart surgery. Cardiac cfDNA was elevated following surgery, reflecting direct surgery-related tissue damage, and declined thereafter in most patients. The concentration of cardiac cfDNA post-surgery correlated with the duration of CPB and aortic cross clamping. Strikingly, cardiac cfDNA at 6 h predicted duration of mechanical ventilation and maximal vasoactive-inotropic score better than did maximal troponin levels. Cardiac cfDNA reveals heart damage associated with CPB, and can be used to monitor cardiac cell death, to predict clinical outcome of surgery and to assess performance of cardioprotective interventions.

AB  - The identification of aberrantly hypermethylated genes may lead to the development of new diagnostic markers and the identification of novel targets of epigenetic therapy in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We therefore investigated the methylation status of transcription factor genes KLF5, KLF11, and MAFB, shown to be aberrantly methylated in myelogeneous leukaemia cells, in a series of 115 MDS patient as well as in 25 control subjects. Using quantitative high-resolution pyrosequencing methodology, KLF11, MAFB, and KLF5 were shown for the first time to be hypermethylated in 17 (15%), 8 (7%), and 2 (1.7%) cases, respectively, but not in any of the patients with an isolated 5q-deletion. Patient samples harbouring KLF11 methylation displayed reduced KLF11 mRNA expression and KLF11 hypermethylation correlated with a high International Prognostic Scoring System score (P < 0.05). In conclusion, epigenetic inactivation and subsequent transcriptional repression of the KLF11 gene is quite frequent in MDS. Patients with an isolated 5q-deletion seem to harbour a distinct epigenetic profile. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Prenatal stress exposure is associated with risk for psychiatric disorders later in life. This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] <= 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression >= 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.

AB  - Low birthweight and reduced height gain during infancy (stunting) may arise at least in part from adverse early life environments that trigger epigenetic reprogramming that may favor survival. We examined differential DNA methylation patterns using targeted methyl sequencing of regions regulating gene activity in groups of rural Gambian infants: (a) low and high birthweight (DNA from cord blood (n = 16 and n = 20, respectively), from placental trophoblast tissue (n = 21 and n = 20, respectively), and DNA from peripheral blood collected from infants at 12 months of age (n = 23 and n = 17, respectively)), and, (b) the top 10% showing rapid postnatal length gain (high, n = 20) and the bottom 10% showing slow postnatal length gain (low, n = 20) based on z score change between birth and 12 months of age (LAZ) (DNA from peripheral blood collected from infants at 12 months of age). Using BiSeq analysis to identify significant methylation marks, for birthweight, four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in trophoblast DNA, compared to 68 DMRs in cord blood DNA, and 54 DMRs in 12-month peripheral blood DNA. Twenty-five DMRs were observed to be associated with high and low length for age (LAZ) at 12 months. With the exception of five loci (associated with two different genes), there was no overlap between these groups of methylation marks. Of the 194 CpG methylation marks contained within DMRs, 106 were located to defined gene regulatory elements (promoters, CTCF-binding sites, transcription factor-binding sites, and enhancers), 58 to gene bodies (introns or exons), and 30 to intergenic DNA. Distinct methylation patterns associated with birthweight between comparison groups were observed in DNA collected at birth (at the end of intrauterine growth window) compared to those established by 12 months (near the infancy/childhood growth transition). The longitudinal differences in methylation patterns may arise from methylation adjustments, changes in cellular composition of blood or both that continue during the critical postnatal growth period, and in response to early nutritional and infectious environmental exposures with impacts on growth and longer-term health outcomes.

AB  - In cattle, several calves born after IVP (“in vitro” embryo production) present similar birthweight to those generated after MOET (multiple ovulation and embryo transfer). However, the underlying molecular patterns in organs involved in the developmental process are unknown and could indicate physiological programming. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare epigenomic and transcriptomic modifications in the hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal and adrenal organs between 3 months old ovum pick-up-IVP and MOET male calves (n = 4 per group) and (2) to use blood epigenomic data to proxy methylation of the inner organs. Extracted gDNA and RNA were sequenced through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing, respectively. Next, bioinformatic analyses determined differentially methylated cytosines (DMC) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR < 0.05) in IVP versus MOET samples and the KEGG pathways that were overrepresented by genes associated with DMC or DEG (FDR < 0.1). Pathways related to hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal (HPG) axis activation (GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus, GnRH signaling in the pituitary, and steroidogenesis in the testicle) were enriched in IVP calves. Modeling the effect of the methylation levels and the group on the expression of all the genes involved in these pathways confirmed their upregulation in HPG organs in IVP calves. The application of the DIABLO method allowed the identification of 15 epigenetic and five transcriptomic biomarkers, which were able to predict the embryo origin using the epigenomic data from the blood. In conclusion, the use of an integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic approach suggested an early activation of the HPG axis in male IVP calves compared to MOET counterparts, and the identification of potential biomarkers allowed the use of blood samples to proxy methylation levels of the relevant internal organs.

AB  - Deletion 1p36 (del1p36) syndrome is the most common human disorder resulting from a terminal autosomal deletion. This condition is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous. Deletions involving two non-overlapping regions, known as the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are sufficient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorphisms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region. Here, we used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to define a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that overlap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. The clinical profile of this disease includes developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention deficit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrow palate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especially in females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co-expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsufficiency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affected females, providing further evidence of a specific contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome-specific episignature that classifies syndromic traits. We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric to the previously established 1p36 critical regions.

AB  - Children who experience environmental adversities are at increased risk of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the influence of environmental adversities on mental health. We examined the hypothesis that salivary DNA-methylation patterns of pace of biological aging (Dunedin pace of biological aging [DunedinPoAm]) and inflammation (DNA-methylation C-reactive protein [DNAm-CRP]) are socially stratified and associated with mental health in 1,183 children (609 female; age: M = 13.6 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Analyses were preregistered. Participants' DNA-methylation algorithms and psychiatric symptoms differed by socioeconomic contexts and race/ethnicity. Children with more parent-reported internalizing symptoms had higher DunedinPoAm and DNAm-CRP scores, and children with more aggression problems had higher DNAm-CRP. DunedinPoAm partially mediated advantage of White racial identity on internalizing. Likewise, DNAm-CRP partially mediated advantage of higher family socioeconomic contexts and, in a separate model, White racial identity on reduced internalizing symptoms. Children's epigenetic measures of pace of biological aging and inflammation are associated with social inequalities and mental health.

AB  - Introduction Child undernutrition is a major risk factor for child mortality and adult ill-health. Despite substantial progress in most health indicators, undernutrition remains high in Sri Lanka, with recent trends being unclear, owing to methodological differences in national surveys. Methods This study uses data from the 1987, 1993, 2000 and 2006-07 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2009 Nutrition and Food Security Survey (NFSS) to investigate trends and determinants of child undernutrition in Sri Lanka. The prevalence rates of stunting, underweight and wasting were re-estimated using the 2006 WHO growth standards to ensure consistency. Multivariate regression analysis was then undertaken to analyse the determinants of height-forage in children aged 9-23 months, and 24-59 months, and the relative impact of key factors was assessed using prediction models. Results Stunting and wasting substantially improved from 1987 to 2000, but rates stagnated from 2000 to 2006/07. Whilst economic inequalities in under nutrition were greater than in most other countries, the multivariate analysis found that maternal height, household wealth, length of breast-feeding and altitude are significant determinants of stunting, but differences in child feeding practices and other factors were not. Of these, maternal height and household wealth had the most influence. Conclusion The results are consistent with the finding that food insecurity is the main driver of undernutrition, but more research is required to validate this. The strong relationship of child height with maternal height suggests that epigenetic factors, proxied by short maternal height, constrain the applicability of the WHO growth standards in Sri Lanka.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the development of noncommunicable diseases in the offspring. Maternal smoking may induce such long-term effects through persistent changes in the DNA methylome, which therefore hold the potential to be used as a biomarker of this early life exposure. With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier ("Reese Score") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is associated with body mass index (BMI), but it is not clear if methylation scores are biomarkers for extant BMI or predictive of future BMI. Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking during pregnancy, especially when sustained, leads to numerous adverse health outcomes in offspring. Pregnant women disproportionately underreport smoking and smokers tend to have lower follow-up rates to repeat questionnaires. Missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data on presence and duration of smoking in pregnancy impairs identification of novel health effects and limits adjustment for smoking in studies of other pregnancy exposures. An objective biomarker in newborns of maternal smoking during pregnancy would be valuable. OBJECTIVES: We developed a biomarker of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy using common DNA methylation platforms. METHODS: Using a dimension reduction method, we developed and tested a numeric score in newborns to reflect sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy from data on cotinine, a short-term smoking biomarker measured mid-pregnancy, and Illumina450K cord blood DNA methylation from newborns in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). RESULTS: This score reliably predicted smoking status in the training set (n = 1,057; accuracy = 96%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 98%). Sensitivity (58%) was predictably lower in the much smaller test set (n = 221), but accuracy (91%) and specificity (97%) remained high. Reduced birth weight, a well-known effect of maternal smoking, was as strongly related to the score as to cotinine. A three-site score had lower, but acceptable, performance (accuracytrain = 82%, accuracytest = 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Our smoking methylation score represents a promising novel biomarker of sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy easily calculated with Illumina450K or IlluminaEPIC data. It may help identify novel health impacts and improve adjustment for smoking when studying other risk factors with more subtle effects.

AB  - Importance: DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment may have implications for the genome that compromise adult health. Objective: To ascertain whether childhood neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with differences in DNA methylation by age 18 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of children born between 1994 and 1995 in England and Wales and followed up from age 5 to 18 years. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2019. Exposures: High-resolution neighborhood data (indexing deprivation, dilapidation, disconnection, and dangerousness) collected across childhood. Main Outcomes and Measures: DNA methylation in whole blood was drawn at age 18 years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and methylation were tested using 3 prespecified approaches: (1) testing probes annotated to candidate genes involved in biological responses to growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and investigated in previous epigenetic research (stress reactivity-related and inflammation-related genes), (2) polyepigenetic scores indexing differential methylation in phenotypes associated with growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods (obesity, inflammation, and smoking), and (3) a theory-free epigenome-wide association study. Results: A total of 1619 participants (806 female individuals [50%]) had complete neighborhood and DNA methylation data. Children raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibited differential DNA methylation in genes involved in inflammation (beta = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P < .001) and smoking (beta = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.25; P < .001) but not obesity (beta = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .12). An epigenome-wide association study identified multiple CpG sites at an arraywide significance level of P < 1.16 x 10-7 in genes involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and methylation were small but robust to family-level socioeconomic factors and to individual-level tobacco smoking. Conclusions and Relevance: Children raised in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood epigenetically distinct from their less disadvantaged peers. This finding suggests that epigenetic regulation may be a mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment alters adult health.

AB  - Background: Prenatal smoke exposure is known to be robustly associated with DNA methylation among offspring in early life, but whether the association persists into adulthood is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of maternal smoke exposure on DNA methylation in 754 women (mean age 30 years); to replicate findings in the same women 18 years later and in a cohort of 230 men (mean age 53 years); and to assess the extent to which a methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure. Methods: We first carried out an epigenome-wide association analysis for prenatal smoke exposure and performed replication analyses for the top CpG sites in the other samples. We derived a DNA methylation score based on previously identified CpG sites and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the performance of these scores as predictors of prenatal smoke exposure. Results: We observed associations at 15 CpG sites in 11 gene regions: MYO1G, FRMD4A, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, ARL4C, AHRR, TIFAB, MDM4, AX748264, DRD1, FTO (false discovery rate<5%). Most of these associations were specific to exposure during pregnancy, were present 18 years later and were replicated in a cohort of men. A DNA methylation score could predict prenatal smoke exposure (30 years previously) with an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69, 0.76). Conclusions: The results of this study provide robust evidence that maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with changes in DNA methylation that persist in the exposed offspring for many years after prenatal exposure.

AB  - The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common genomic disorder in humans and is the result of a recurrent 1.5 to 2.5 Mb deletion, encompassing approximately 20-40 genes, respectively. The clinical presentation of the typical deletion includes: Velocardiofacial, Di George, Opitz G/BBB and Conotruncalanomaly face syndromes. Atypical deletions (proximal, distal or nested) are rare and characterized mainly by normal phenotype or mild intellectual disability and variable clinical features. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this disorder are not completely understood. Because the 22q11.2 region harbours genes coding for transcriptional factors and chromatin remodelers, in this study, we performed analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of peripheral blood from 49 patients with 22q11.2DS using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip arrays. This cohort comprises 43 typical, 2 proximal and 4 distal deletions. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific episignature in all typical and proximal 22q11.2DS. The sensitivity and specificity of this signature was further confirmed by comparing it to over 1500 patients with other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. Mapping the 22q11.2DS DNA methylation episignature provides both novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and an effective tool in the molecular diagnosis of 22q11.2DS.

AB  - Purpose: HNRNPU haploinsufficiency is associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 54. This neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and early-onset epilepsy. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis in a cohort of individuals to develop a diagnostic biomarker and gain functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of HNRNPU-related disorder. Methods: DNAm profiles of individuals carrying pathogenic HNRNPU variants, identified through an international multicenter collaboration, were assessed using Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays. Statistical and functional correlation analyses were performed comparing the HNRNPU cohort with 56 previously reported DNAm episignatures. Results: A robust and reproducible DNAm episignature and global DNAm profile were identified. Correlation analysis identified partial overlap and similarity of the global HNRNPU DNAm profile to several other rare disorders. Conclusion: This study demonstrates new evidence of a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature associated with pathogenic heterozygous HNRNPU variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for the expansion of the EpiSign diagnostic test.

AB  - Background: Advanced biological aging, as measured by epigenetic aging indices, is associated with early mortality and morbidity. Associations between maternal epigenetic aging indices in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, namely gestational length and birthweight, have not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to examine whether epigenetic age during pregnancy was associated with gestational length and birthweight. Results: The sample consisted of 77 women from the Los Angeles, CA, area enrolled in the Healthy Babies Before Birth study. Whole blood samples for DNA methylation assay were obtained during the second trimester (15.6 +/- 2.15 weeks gestation). Epigenetic age indices GrimAge acceleration (GrimAgeAccel), DNAm PAI-1, DNAm ADM, and DNAm cystatin C were calculated. Gestational length and birthweight were obtained from medical chart review. Covariates were maternal sociodemographic variables, gestational age at blood sample collection, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. In separate covariate-adjusted linear regression models, higher early second trimester GrimAgeAccel, b(SE) = -.171 (.056), p = .004; DNAm PAI-1, b(SE) = - 1.95 x 10(-4) (8.5 x 10(-5)), p =.004; DNAm ADM, b(SE) = -.033 (.011), p = .003; and DNAm cystatin C, b(SE) = 2.10 x 10(-5) (8.0 x 10(-5)), p = .012, were each associated with shorter gestational length. Higher GrimAgeAccel, b(SE) = - 75.2 (19.7), p < .001; DNAm PAI-1, b(SE) = -.079(.031), p = .013; DNAm ADM, b(SE) = - 13.8 (3.87), p = .001; and DNAm cystatin C, b(SE) = -.010 (.003), p = .001, were also associated with lower birthweight, independent of gestational length. Discussion: Higher maternal prenatal GrimAgeAccel, DNAm PAI-1, DNAm ADM, and DNAm cystatin C were associated with shorter gestational length and lower birthweight. These findings suggest that biological age, as measured by these epigenetic indices, could indicate risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Domain Z7 of nuclear transcription factor ZNF711 has the consensus last metal-ligand H23 found in odd-numbered zinc-fingers of this protein replaced by a phenylalanine. Ever since the discovery of ZNF711 it has been thought that Z7 is probably non-functional because of the H23F substitution. The presence of H26 three positions downstream prompted us to examine if this histidine could substitute as the last metal ligand. The Z7 domain adopts a stable tertiary structure upon metal binding. The NMR structure of Zn2+-bound Z7 shows the classical betabetaalpha-fold of CCHH zinc fingers. Mutagenesis and pH titration experiments indicate that H26 is not involved in metal binding and that Z7 has a tridentate metal-binding site comprised of only residues C3, C6, and H19. By contrast, an F23H mutation that introduces a histidine in the consensus position forms a tetradentate ligand. The structure of the WT Z7 is stable causing restricted ring-flipping of phenyalanines 10 and 23. Dynamics are increased with either the H26A or F23H substitutions and aromatic ring rotation is no longer hindered in the two mutants. The mutations have only small effects on the Kd values for Zn2+ and Co2+ and retain the high thermal stability of the WT domain above 80 degreeC. Like two previously reported designed zinc fingers with the last ligand replaced by water, the WT Z7 domain is catalytically active, hydrolyzing 4-nitophenyl acetate. We discuss the implications of naturally occurring tridentate zinc fingers for cancer mutations and drug targeting of notoriously undruggable transcription factors. Our findings that Z7 can fold with only a subset of three metal ligands suggests the recent view that most everything about protein structure can be predicted through homology modeling might be premature for at least the resilient and versatile zinc-finger motif.

AB  - Purpose: BCL11B-related disorder (BCL11B-RD) arises from rare genetic variants within the BCL11B gene, resulting in a distinctive clinical spectrum encompassing syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder, with or without intellectual disability, associated with facial features and impaired immune function. This study presents an in-depth clinico-biological analysis of 20 newly reported individuals with BCL11B-RD, coupled with a characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of this genetic condition. Methods: Through an international collaboration, clinical and molecular data from 20 individuals were systematically gathered, and a comparative analysis was conducted between this series and existing literature. We further scrutinized peripheral blood DNA methylation profile of individuals with BCL11B-RD, contrasting them with healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders marked by established episignature. Results: Our findings unveil rarely documented clinical manifestations, notably including Rubinstein-Taybi-like facial features, craniosynostosis, and autoimmune disorders, all manifesting within the realm of BCL11B-RD. We refine the intricacies of T cell compartment alterations of BCL11B-RD, revealing decreased levels naive CD4+ T cells and recent thymic emigrants while concurrently observing an elevated proportion of effector-memory expressing CD45RA CD8+ T cells (TEMRA). Finally, a distinct DNA methylation episignature exclusive to BCL11B-RD is unveiled. Conclusion: This study serves to enrich our comprehension of the clinico-biological landscape of BCL11B-RD, potentially furnishing a more precise framework for diagnosis and follow-up of individuals carrying pathogenic BCL11B variant. Moreover, the identification of a unique DNA methylation episignature offers a valuable diagnosis tool for BCL11B-RD, thereby facilitating routine clinical practice by empowering physicians to reevaluate variants of uncertain significance within the BCL11B gene.

AB  - There is strong evidence linking changes in DNA methylation with cigarette smoking, and smoking has long been associated with cardiovascular disease; however not many studies have investigated the effects of smoking related DNA methylation changes on cardiovascular risk, especially in young adults. We explored this relationship in 480 African American and European American men and women aged 27.3+/-3.5. Out of the DNA methylation data obtained from Illumina 450k in peripheral leukocytes, 62 CpG sites that have been associated with smoking in multiple studies were selected. Of these, 48 were significantly related to smoking within our population. These CpG sites were then used to predict 2 subclinical markers of cardiovascular health: carotid intima media thickness and left ventricular mass (LVM). There was a significant association (FDR<0.05) between LVM and 13 of these CpG sites. We constructed a DNA methylation score using these CpG sites and found a significant association between this score and LVM (p<0.01). Mediation test showed that 36.5% of the effect of smoking on LVM could be explained by this methylation score. Our data suggests that, in young adult populations, cigarette smoking related DNA methylation changes are already associated with changes in subclinical markers of cardiovascular health.

AB  - PURPOSE: We describe the clinical implementation of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in rare disorders across the EpiSign diagnostic laboratory network and the assessment of results and clinical impact in the first subjects tested. METHODS: We outline the logistics and data flow between an integrated network of clinical diagnostics laboratories in Europe, the United States, and Canada. We describe the clinical validation of EpiSign using 211 specimens and assess the test performance and diagnostic yield in the first 207 subjects tested involving two patient subgroups: the targeted cohort (subjects with previous ambiguous/inconclusive genetic findings including genetic variants of unknown clinical significance) and the screening cohort (subjects with clinical findings consistent with hereditary neurodevelopmental syndromes and no previous conclusive genetic findings). RESULTS: Among the 207 subjects tested, 57 (27.6%) were positive for a diagnostic episignature including 48/136 (35.3%) in the targeted cohort and 8/71 (11.3%) in the screening cohort, with 4/207 (1.9%) remaining inconclusive after EpiSign analysis. CONCLUSION: This study describes the implementation of diagnostic clinical genomic DNA methylation testing in patients with rare disorders. It provides strong evidence of clinical utility of EpiSign analysis, including the ability to provide conclusive findings in the majority of subjects tested.

AB  - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an overlap of myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasm, is an intractable pediatric myeloid neoplasm. Epigenetic regulation of transcription, particularly by CpG methylation, plays an important role in tumor progression, mainly by repressing tumor-suppressor genes. To clarify the clinical importance of aberrant DNA methylation, we studied the hypermethylation status of 16 target genes in the genomes of 92 patients with JMML by bisulfite conversion and the pryosequencing technique. Among 16 candidate genes, BMP4, CALCA, CDKN2A, and RARB exhibited significant hypermethylation in 72% (67/92) of patients. Based on the number of hypermethylated genes, patients were stratified into three cohorts based on an aberrant methylation score (AMS) of 0, 1-2, or 3-4. In the AMS 0 cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and transplantation-free survival (TFS) were good (69% and 76%, respectively). In the AMS 1-2 cohort, the 5-year OS was comparable to that in the AMS 0 cohort (68%), whereas TFS was poor (6%). In the AMS 3-4 cohort, 5-year OS and TFS were markedly low (8% and 0%, respectively). Epigenetic analysis provides helpful information for clinicians to select treatment strategies for patients with JMML. For patients with AMS 3-4 in whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not improve the prognosis, alternative therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and new molecular-targeting agents, should be established as treatment options.

AB  - Blepharophimosis with intellectual disability (BIS) is a recently recognized disorder distinct from Nicolaides-Baraister syndrome that presents with distinct facial features of blepharophimosis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. BIS is caused by pathogenic variants in SMARCA2, that encodes the catalytic subunit of the superfamily II helicase group of the BRG1 and BRM-associated factors (BAF) forming the BAF complex, a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcriptional regulation. Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype-specific episignature. A distinct episignature was shared by 15 individuals with BIS-causing SMARCA2 pathogenic variants and 12 individuals with class II HVDAS caused by truncating pathogenic ADNP variants. This represents first evidence of a sensitive phenotype-specific episignature biomarker shared across distinct genetic conditions that also exhibit unique gene-specific episignatures.

AB  - Mediation analysis attempts to determine whether the relationship between an independent variable (e.g., exposure) and an outcome variable can be explained, at least partially, by an intermediate variable, called a mediator. Most methods for mediation analysis focus on one mediator at a time, although multiple mediators can be jointly analyzed by structural equation models (SEMs) that account for correlations among the mediators. We extend the use of SEMs for the analysis of multiple mediators by creating a sparse group lasso penalized model such that the penalty considers the natural groupings of parameters that determine mediation, as well as encourages sparseness of the model parameters. This provides a way to simultaneously evaluate many mediators and select those that have the most impact, a feature of modern penalized models. Simulations are used to illustrate the benefits and limitations of our approach, and application to a study of DNA methylation and reactive cortisol stress following childhood trauma discovered two novel methylation loci that mediate the association of childhood trauma scores with reactive cortisol stress levels. Our new methods are incorporated into R software called regmed.

AB  - DNA methylation is assumed to be complementary on both alleles across the genome, although there are exceptions, notably in regions subject to genomic imprinting. We present a genome-wide survey of the degree of allelic skewing of DNA methylation with the aim of identifying previously unreported differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated primarily with genomic imprinting or DNA sequence variation acting in cis. We used SNP microarrays to quantitatively assess allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) in amplicons covering 7.6% of the human genome following cleavage with a cocktail of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MSREs). Selected findings were verified using bisulfite-mapping and gene-expression analyses, subsequently tested in a second tissue from the same individuals, and replicated in DNA obtained from 30 parent-child trios. Our approach detected clear examples of ASM in the vicinity of known imprinted loci, highlighting the validity of the method. In total, 2,704 (1.5%) of our 183,605 informative and stringently filtered SNPs demonstrate an average relative allele score (RAS) change ≥0.10 following MSRE digestion. In agreement with previous reports, the majority of ASM (∼90%) appears to be cis in nature, and several examples of tissue-specific ASM were identified. Our data show that ASM is a widespread phenomenon, with >35,000 such sites potentially occurring across the genome, and that a spectrum of ASM is likely, with heterogeneity between individuals and across tissues. These findings impact our understanding about the origin of individual phenotypic differences and have implications for genetic studies of complex disease. © 2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.

AB  - Background: Phelan-McDermid syndrome is characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. It is caused by a variable size and breakpoint microdeletions in the distal long arm of chromosome 22, referred to as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, including the SHANK3 gene. Genetic defects in a growing number of neurodevelopmental genes have been shown to cause genome-wide disruptions in epigenomic profiles referred to as epi-signatures in affected individuals. Results: In this study we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 22 individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including 11 individuals with large (2 to 5.8 Mb) 22q13.3 deletions, 10 with small deletions (< 1 Mb) or intragenic variants in SHANK3 and one mosaic case. We describe a novel genome-wide DNA methylation epi-signature in a subset of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Conclusion: We identified the critical region including the BRD1 gene as responsible for the Phelan-McDermid syndrome epi-signature. Metabolomic profiles of individuals with the DNA methylation epi-signature showed significantly different metabolomic profiles indicating evidence of two molecularly and phenotypically distinct clinical subtypes of Phelan-McDermid syndrome.

AB  - Background: Claes-Jensen syndrome is an X-linked inherited intellectual disability caused by mutations in the KDM5C gene. Kdm5c is a histone lysine demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients. Results: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts with previously described epi-signatures. Conclusion: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C gene.

AB  - Background: Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked syndrome (ATR-X) is caused by a mutation at the chromatin regulator gene ATRX. The mechanisms involved in the ATR-X pathology are not completely understood, but may involve epigenetic modifications. ATRX has been linked to the regulation of histone H3 and DNA methylation, while mutations in the ATRX gene may lead to the downstream epigenetic and transcriptional effects. Elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanisms altered in ATR-X will provide a better understanding about the pathobiology of this disease, as well as provide novel diagnostic biomarkers. Results: We performed genome-wide DNA methylation assessment of the peripheral blood samples from 18 patients with ATR-X and compared it to 210 controls. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific DNA methylation "epi-signature" in the peripheral blood of ATRX patients, which was corroborated by targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. Although genomically represented, differentially methylated regions showed evidence of preferential clustering in pericentromeric and telometric chromosomal regions, areas where ATRX has multiple functions related to maintenance of heterochromatin and genomic integrity. Conclusion: Most significant methylation changes in the 14 genomic loci provide a unique epigenetic signature for this syndrome that may be used as a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker to support the diagnosis of ATR-X, particularly in patients with phenotypic complexity and in patients with ATRX gene sequence variants of unknown significance.

AB  - AIMS: Paediatric brain tumours are rare, and establishing a precise diagnosis can be challenging. Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort. METHODS: All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist. RESULTS: Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness due to loss of function mutations in the dystrophin gene. Variation in clinical presentation, the rate of disease progression, and treatment responsiveness have been observed amongst DMD patients, suggesting that factors beyond the loss of dystrophin may contribute to DMD pathophysiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called “episignatures”) that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. By modeling the DMD episignature, we developed a new DMD episignature biomarker and provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, which have the potential to advance more effective, personalized approaches to DMD care.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is interest in evaluating the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) which emphasizes the role of prenatal and early-life environments on non-communicable health outcomes throughout the life course. The ability to rigorously assess and identify early-life risk factors for later health outcomes, including those with childhood onset, in large population samples is often limited due to measurement challenges such as impractical costs associated with prospective studies with a long follow-up duration, short half-lives for some environmental toxicants, and lack of biomarkers that capture inter-individual differences in biologic response to external environments. RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenomic patterns, and DNA methylation in particular, have emerged as a potential objective biomarker to address some of these study design and exposure measurement challenges. In this article, we summarize the literature to date on epigenetic changes associated with specific prenatal and early-life exposure domains as well as exposure mixtures in human observational studies and their biomarker potential. Additionally, we highlight evidence for other types of epigenetic patterns to serve as exposure biomarkers. Evidence strongly supports epigenomic biomarkers of exposure that are detectable across the lifespan and across a range of exposure domains. Current and future areas of research in this field seek to expand these lines of evidence to other environmental exposures, to determine their specificity, and to develop predictive algorithms and methylation scores that can be used to evaluate early-life risk factors for health outcomes across the life span.

AB  - Edematous severe acute childhood malnutrition (edematous SAM or ESAM), which includes kwashiorkor, presents with more overt multi-organ dysfunction than non-edematous SAM (NESAM). Reduced concentrations and methyl-flux of methionine in 1-carbon metabolism have been reported in acute, but not recovered, ESAM, suggesting downstream DNA methylation changes could be relevant to differences in SAM pathogenesis. Here, we assess genome-wide DNA methylation in buccal cells of 309 SAM children using the 450 K microarray. Relative to NESAM, ESAM is characterized by multiple significantly hypomethylated loci, which is not observed among SAM-recovered adults. Gene expression and methylation show both positive and negative correlation, suggesting a complex transcriptional response to SAM. Hypomethylated loci link to disorders of nutrition and metabolism, including fatty liver and diabetes, and appear to be influenced by genetic variation. Our epigenetic findings provide a potential molecular link to reported aberrant 1-carbon metabolism in ESAM and support consideration of methyl-group supplementation in ESAM.

AB  - Childhood trauma has been proposed to increase vulnerability to develop psychopathology in part through an altered cortisol stress response. Research in rats has suggested that this effect is mediated by methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor 17 region (GR-17 or GR-1F in humans), with higher methylation after poor maternal care leading to an increased cortisol stress response in adulthood. In humans, the associations between childhood trauma and GR-1F methylation or the cortisol stress response are equivocal. Remarkably, evidence for the relation between GR-1F methylation and the cortisol stress response has been conflicting as well. To further explore this, we investigated the associations of peripheral GR-1F methylation (52 CpGs) with the cortisol stress response (Trier Social Stress Test) and with childhood trauma in three independent studies (total N=241) including healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and unaffected siblings of patients with one of these disorders. We did not find any significant association between GR-1F methylation and the cortisol stress response (areas under the curve) or childhood trauma, nor did we observe any group differences between patients, siblings and healthy controls. Our findings do not support GR-1F methylation as a proxy for the cortisol stress response, nor its link with childhood trauma or psychopathology. These results suggest that multifactorial models for stress-related psychopathology are needed. Alternatively, future longitudinal studies may reveal GR-1F methylation to be a useful parameter at an individual level. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Individual differences in risk for mental disorders over the lifespan are shaped by forces acting before the individual is born-in utero, but likely even earlier, during the mother's own childhood. The environmental epigenetics hypothesis proposes that sustained effects of environmental conditions on gene expression are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent human studies have shown that adversities in childhood are correlated with DNA methylation (DNAm) in adulthood. In the current study, we tested the following pre-registered hypotheses: Mothers' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are correlated with DNAm in peripheral blood during pregnancy (hypothesis 1) and in cord blood samples from newborn infants (hypothesis 2), and women's depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy mediate the association between mothers' ACE exposure and prenatal/neonatal DNA methylation (hypothesis 3). METHOD: Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies substudy. Women provided retrospective self-reports during pregnancy of ACE exposure. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study testing whether mothers' ACE exposure, cumulative score (0-10), was associated with DNAm in maternal antenatal blood and infant cord blood in more than 450,000 CpG (point on DNA sequence where cytosine and guanine base pairs are linked by a phosphate, where methylation usually occurs) sites on the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Analyses for cord blood were separated by infant sex, a pre-registered analysis. RESULTS: Hypothesis 1: In 896 mother-infant pairs with available methylation and ACE exposure data, there were no significant associations between mothers' ACE score and DNAm from antenatal peripheral blood, after controlling for covariates. Hypothesis 2: In infant cord blood, there were 5 CpG sites significantly differentially methylated in relation to mothers' ACEs (false discovery rate [FDR] < .05), but only in male offspring. Effect sizes were medium, with partial eta squared values ranging from 0.060 to 0.078. CpG sites were in genes related to mitochondrial function and neuronal development in the cerebellum. Hypothesis 3: There was no mediation by maternal anxiety/depression symptoms found between mothers' ACEs score and DNAm in the significant CpG sites in male cord blood. Mediation was not tested in antenatal peripheral blood, because no direct association between mothers' ACE score and antenatal peripheral blood was found. CONCLUSION: Our results show that mothers' ACE exposure is associated with DNAm in male offspring, supporting the notion that DNAm could be a marker of intergenerational biological embedding of mothers' childhood adversity.

AB  - Epigenetic modifications occur sequentially during the lifespan, but their pace can be altered by external stimuli. The onset of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is critically modulated by stressors that may alter the epigenetic pattern, a putative signature marker of exposure to environmental risk factors. In this study, we estimated the age-related epigenetic modifications to assess the differences between young individuals at familial high risk (FHR) and controls and their association with environmental stressors. The sample included 117 individuals (6-17 years) at FHR (45%) and a control group (55%). Blood and saliva samples were used estimate the epigenetic age with six epigenetic clocks through methylation data. Environmental risk was measured with obstetric complications, socioeconomic statuses and recent stressful life events data. Epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age. FHR individuals showed epigenetic age deacceleration of Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clocks compared to controls. No effect of the environmental risk factors on the epigenetic age acceleration could be detected. Epigenetic age acceleration adjusted by cell counts showed that the FHR group was deaccelerated also with the PedBE epigenetic clock. Epigenetic age asynchronicities were found in the young at high risk, suggesting that offspring of affected parents follow a slower pace of biological aging than the control group. It still remains unclear which environmental stressors orchestrate the changes in the methylation pattern. Further studies are needed to better characterize the molecular impact of environmental stressors before illness onset, which could be critical in the development of tools for personalized psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Puberty is a highly heritable and variable trait, with environmental factors having a role in its eventual timing and development. Early and late pubertal onset are both associated with various diseases developing later in life, and epigenetic characterisation of pubertal timing and development could lead to important insights. Blood DNA methylation, reacting to both genotype and environment, has been associated with puberty; however, such studies are relatively scarce. We investigated peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles (using Illumina 450 K and EPIC platforms) of 1539 young adult Finnish twins associated with pubertal development scale (PDS) at ages 12 and 14 as well as pubertal age (PA). Results: Fixed effect meta-analysis of the two platforms on 347,521 CpGs in common identified 58 CpG sites associated (p < 1 × 10−5) with either PDS or PA. All four CpGs associated with PA and 45 CpGs associated with PDS were sex-specific. Thirteen CpGs had a high heritability (h2: 0.51–0.98), while one CpG site (mapped to GET4) had a high shared environmental component accounting for 68% of the overall variance in methylation at the site. Utilising twin discordance analysis, we found 6 CpG sites (5 associated with PDS and 1 with PA) that had an environmentally driven association with puberty. Furthermore, genes with PDS- or PA-associated CpGs were consistently linked to various developmental processes and diseases such as breast, prostate and ovarian cancer, while methylation quantitative trait loci of associated CpG sites were enriched in immune pathways developing during puberty. Conclusions: By identifying puberty-associated DNA methylation sites and examining the effects of sex, environment and genetics, we shed light on the intricate interplay between environment and genetics in the context of puberty. Through our comprehensive analysis, we not only deepen the understanding of the significance of both genetic and environmental factors in the complex processes of puberty and its timing, but also gain insights into potential links with disease risks.

AB  - Lower fine motor performance in childhood has been associated with poorer cognitive development and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, yet, biological underpinnings remain unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for healthy neurodevelopment, is a key molecular system of interest. In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm with childhood fine motor ability and further examined the replicability of epigenetic markers in an independent cohort. The discovery study was embedded in Generation R, a large population-based prospective cohort, including a subsample of 924 ~ 1026 European-ancestry singletons with available data on DNAm in cord blood and fine motor ability at a mean (SD) age of 9.8 (0.4) years. Fine motor ability was measured using a finger-tapping test (3 subtests including left-, right-hand and bimanual), one of the most frequently used neuropsychological instruments of fine motor function. The replication study comprised 326 children with a mean (SD) age of 6.8 (0.4) years from an independent cohort, the INfancia Medio Ambiente (INMA) study. Four CpG sites at birth were prospectively associated with childhood fine motor ability after genome-wide correction. Of these, one CpG (cg07783800 in GNG4) was replicated in INMA, showing that lower levels of methylation at this site were associated with lower fine motor performance in both cohorts. GNG4 is highly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in cognitive decline. Our findings support a prospective, reproducible association between DNAm at birth and fine motor ability in childhood, pointing to GNG4 methylation at birth as a potential biomarker of fine motor ability.

AB  - Lasting changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are a potential indication of the biological embedding of early life adversity, yet, prospective and repeatedly collected data are needed to confirm this relation. Likewise, integrating information from multiple biological systems, such as the HPA axis and the epigenome, has the potential to identify individuals with enhanced embedding of early life adversity. The current study reports results from the Female Growth and Development Study, a 30-year prospective cohort study of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Females exposed to substantiated CSA and a demographically-similar comparison condition were enrolled and resting state cortisol concentrations were sampled on seven subsequent occasions across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Differences in participants’ cortisol trajectories were examined in relation to prior CSA exposure and DNA methylation-derived epigenetic age acceleration at midlife. Bilinear spline growth models revealed a trajectory where cortisol secretion increased until approximately age twenty and then declined into mid-life, consistent with normative trends. However, cortisol concentrations peaked at a lower level and transitioned to the decline phase at an earlier age for females in the CSA condition with increased epigenetic age acceleration. Robustness tests across three independent measures of epigenetic age acceleration demonstrated similar results for lower peak cortisol levels and earlier ages at transition. Results suggest that CSA is associated with significant changes in HPA-axis activity over extended periods of time with these changes most pronounced in females with accelerated epigenetic aging in mid-life. Implications for biological embedding models of early life adversity and adulthood health are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes in infants and children with potential lifelong consequences. Negative effects of MSDP on placental DNA methylation (DNAm), placental structure, and function are well established. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop biomarkers of MSDP using DNAm measured in placentas (N = 96), collected as part of the Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted between 2012 and 2016. We also aimed to develop a digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the top ranking cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) so that large numbers of samples can be screened for exposure at low cost. METHODS: We compared the ability of four machine learning methods [logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosting machine] to classify MSDP based on placental DNAm signatures. We developed separate models using the complete EPIC array dataset and on the subset of probes also found on the 450K array so that models exist for both platforms. For comparison, we developed a model using CpGs previously associated with MSDP in placenta. For each final model, we used model coefficients and normalized beta values to calculate placental smoking index (PSI) scores for each sample. Final models were validated in two external datasets: the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn observational study, N = 426; and the Rhode Island Children's Health Study, N = 237. RESULTS: Logistic LASSO regression demonstrated the highest performance in cross-validation testing with the lowest number of input CpGs. Accuracy was greatest in external datasets when using models developed for the same platform. PSI scores in smokers only (n = 72) were moderately correlated with maternal plasma cotinine levels. One CpG (cg27402634), with the largest coefficient in two models, was measured accurately by digital PCR compared with measurement by EPIC array (R2 = 0.98). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, we have developed the first placental DNAm-based biomarkers of MSDP with broad utility to studies of prenatal disease origins. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13838.

AB  - Background: Epigenetic Scores (EpiScores) for blood protein levels have been associated with disease outcomes and measures of brain health, highlighting their potential usefulness as clinical biomarkers. They are typically derived via penalised regression, whereby a linear weighted sum of DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at CpG sites are predictive of protein levels. Here, we examine 84 previously published protein EpiScores as possible biomarkers of cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of general cognitive function and brain health, and incident dementia across three independent cohorts. Results: Using 84 protein EpiScores as candidate biomarkers, associations with general cognitive function (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally) were tested in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland (GS), and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (LBC1921 and LBC1936, respectively). A meta-analysis of general cognitive functioning results in all three cohorts identified 18 EpiScore associations (absolute meta-analytic standardised estimates ranged from 0.03 to 0.14, median of 0.04, PFDR < 0.05). Several associations were also observed between EpiScores and global brain volumetric measures in the LBC1936. An EpiScore for the S100A9 protein (a known Alzheimer disease biomarker) was associated with general cognitive functioning (meta-analytic standardised beta: − 0.06, P = 1.3 × 10−9), and with time-to-dementia in GS (Hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08–1.44, P = 0.003), but not in LBC1936 (Hazard ratio 1.11, P = 0.32). Conclusions: EpiScores might make a contribution to the risk profile of poor general cognitive function and global brain health, and risk of dementia, however these scores require replication in further studies.

AB  - Asthma exacerbation and other respiratory symptoms are associated with exposure to air pollution. Since environment affects gene methylation, it is hypothesized that asthmatic responses to pollution are mediated through methylation. Materials & methods: We study the possibility that airborne particulate matter affects gene methylation in the asthma pathway. We measured methylation array data in clinic visits of 141 subjects from the Normative Aging Study. Black carbon and sulfate measures from a central monitoring site were recorded and 30-day averages were calculated for each clinic visit. Gene-specific methylation scores were calculated for the genes in the asthma pathway, and the association between the methylation in the asthma pathway and the pollution measures was analyzed using sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis. Results: The analysis found that exposures to black carbon and sulfate were significantly associated with the methylation pattern in the asthma pathway (p-values 0.05 and 0.02, accordingly). Specific genes that contributed to this association were identified. Conclusion: These results suggest that the effect of air pollution on asthmatic and respiratory responses may be mediated through gene methylation.

AB  - Growing evidence has linked inflammatory processes to cognitive decline and dementia. This work examines whether an epigenetic marker of C-reactive protein (CRP), a common clinical inflammatory biomarker, may mediate the relationship between educational attainment and cognition. We first evaluated whether 53 previously-reported CRP-associated DNA methylation sites (CpGs) are associated with CRP, both individually and aggregated into a methylation risk score (MRSCRP), in 3298 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, mean age=69.7 years). Forty-nine CpGs (92%) were associated with the natural logarithm of CRP in HRS after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, BMI, genetic ancestry, and white blood cell counts (p<0.05), and each standard deviation increase in MRSCRP was associated a 0.38 unit increase in lnCRP (p=4.02E-99). In cross-sectional analysis, for each standard deviation increase in MRSCRP, total memory score and total cognitive score decreased, on average, by 0.28 words and 0.43 items, respectively (p<0.001). Further, MRSCRP mediated 6.9% of the relationship between high school education and total memory score in a model adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry (p<0.05); this was attenuated to 2.4% with additional adjustment for marital status, APOE epsilon4 status, health behaviors, and comorbidities (p<0.05). Thus, CRP-associated methylation may partially mediate the relationship between education and cognition at older ages. Further research is warranted to determine whether DNA methylation at these sites may improve current prediction models for cognitive impairment in older adults. Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy may enhance fetal exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) and harm neurodevelopment. We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative of in utero exposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (n = 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (n = 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (n = 583). RESULTS: The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, p = 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, p = 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, p < 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.

AB  - Large-scale epigenome-wide association meta-analyses have identified multiple 'signatures'' of smoking. Drawing on these findings, we describe the construction of a polyepigenetic DNA methylation score that indexes smoking behavior and that can be utilized for multiple purposes in population health research. To validate the score, we use data from two birth cohort studies: The Dunedin Longitudinal Study, followed to age-38 years, and the Environmental Risk Study, followed to age-18 years. Longitudinal data show that changes in DNA methylation accumulate with increased exposure to tobacco smoking and attenuate with quitting. Data from twins discordant for smoking behavior show that smoking influences DNA methylation independently of genetic and environmental risk factors. Physiological data show that changes in DNA methylation track smoking-related changes in lung function and gum health over time. Moreover, DNA methylation changes predict corresponding changes in gene expression in pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and cellular trafficking. Finally, we present prospective data about the link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and epigenetic modifications; these findings document the importance of controlling for smoking-related DNA methylation changes when studying biological embedding of stress in life-course research. We introduce the polyepigenetic DNA methylation score as a tool both for discovery and theory-guided research in epigenetic epidemiology.

AB  - Experiencing adversity in childhood and adolescence, including stressful life events (SLEs), may accelerate the pace of development, leading to adverse mental and physical health. However, most research on adverse early experiences and biological aging (BA) in youths relies on cross-sectional designs. In 171 youths followed for approximately 2 years, we examined if SLEs over follow-up predicted rate of change in two BA metrics: epigenetic age and Tanner stage. We also investigated if rate of change in BA was associated with changes in depressive symptoms over time. Youths aged 8–16 years at baseline self-reported Tanner stage and depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up and provided saliva samples for DNA at both assessments. Horvath epigenetic age estimates were derived from DNA methylation data measured with the Illumina EPIC array. At follow-up, contextual threat interviews were administered to youths and caregivers to assess youths’ experiences of past-year SLEs. Interviews were objectively coded by an independent rating team to generate a SLE impact score, reflecting the severity of all SLEs occurring over the prior year. Rate of change in BA metrics was operationalized as change in epigenetic age or Tanner stage as a function of time between assessments. Higher objective SLE impact scores over follow-up were related to a greater rate of change in epigenetic age (β = 0.21, p = .043). Additionally, among youths with lower—but not higher—Tanner stage at baseline, there was a positive association of SLE impact scores with rate of change in Tanner stage (Baseline Tanner Stage × SLE Impact Score interaction: β = − 0.21, p = .011). A greater rate of change in epigenetic age was also associated with higher depressive symptom levels at follow-up, adjusting for baseline symptoms (β = 0.15, p = .043). Associations with epigenetic age were similar, although slightly attenuated, when adjusting for epithelial (buccal) cell proportions. Whereas much research in youths has focused on severe experiences of early adversity, we demonstrate that more commonly experienced SLEs during adolescence may also contribute to accelerated BA. Further research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of changes in BA metrics for health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative life events (NLEs) increase the risk for externalizing behaviors (EBs) and internalizing behaviors (IBs) in adolescence and adult psychopathology. DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - According to the recently published 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid malignancies, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) include atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and MDS/MPN ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T). MDS/MPN-RS-T was previously a provisional category known as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis (RARS-T) which has now attained a distinct designation in the 2016 WHO classification. In this review, we focus on biology and management of aCML, MDS/MPN-U, and MDS/MPN-RS-T. There is considerable overlap between these entities which we attempt to further elucidate in this review. We also discuss recent advances in the field of molecular landscape that further defines and characterizes this heterogeneous group of disorders. The paucity of clinical trials available secondary to unclear pathogenesis and rarity of these diseases makes the management of these entities clinically challenging. This review summarizes some of the current knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and suggested treatment guidelines based on the available data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying blood-based DNA methylation patterns is a minimally invasive way to detect biomarkers in predicting age, characteristics of certain diseases and conditions, as well as responses to immunotherapies. As microarray platforms continue to evolve and increase the scope of CpGs measured, new discoveries based on the most recent platform version and how they compare to available data from the previous versions of the platform are unknown. The neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI 850) is a blood-based DNA methylation biomarker built on the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array that measures epigenetic responses to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid often administered for inflammation. Here, we compare the NDMI 850 to one we built using data from the Illumina Methylation 450K (NDMI 450). RESULTS: The NDMI 450 consisted of 22 loci, 15 of which were present on the NDMI 850. In adult whole blood samples, the linear composite scores from NDMI 450 and NDMI 850 were highly correlated and had equivalent predictive accuracy for detecting DEX exposure among adult glioma patients and non-glioma adult controls. However, the NDMI 450 scores of newborn cord blood were significantly lower than NDMI 850 in samples measured with both assays. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an algorithm that reproduces the DNA methylation glucocorticoid response score using 450K data, increasing the accessibility for researchers to assess this biomarker in archived or publicly available datasets that use the 450K version of the Illumina BeadChip array. However, the NDMI850 and NDMI450 do not give similar results in cord blood, and due to data availability limitations, results from sample types of newborn cord blood should be interpreted with care.

AB  - Background: As an epigenetic alteration, DNA methylation plays an important role in early Wilms tumorigenesis and is possibly used as marker to improve the diagnosis and classification of tumor heterogeneity. Methods: Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified. Results: Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data. Conclusion: Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis. Copyright © 2021 Tang, Lu, Lei, Lai, Lu, Li, Tang, Zhang and He.

AB  - Earlier GWAS has identified that rs17782313 near MC4R was associated with obesity. However, subsequent studies showed conflicting results, especially among childhood. Besides, the mechanisms underlying the association between rs17782313 and childhood obesity remain largely unexplored, and genetic and epigenetic may interact and together affect the development of childhood obesity. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess the association between rs17782313 and childhood obesity. MeQTL and eQTL analysis was applied to explore the effect of rs17782313 on DNA methylation and MC4R expression. We found that rs17782313 near MC4R was associated with increased childhood obesity risk and BMI z-score in several inheritable models (P < 0.05). Additionally, the similar trend was observed among subgroups of Asians, Caucasian. Furthermore, meQTL and eQTL analysis indicated that individuals carrying rs17782313 TT genotype were significantly associated with increased methylation level of cg10097150 located in MC4R promoter and decreased expression of MC4R than those with CT/CC genotype (P = 1.7 × 10-4 and P = 1.9 × 10-3 respectively). Our results strongly confirmed that rs17782313 was associated with increased risk of childhood obesity. Furthermore, rs17782313 T allele was correlated with promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of MC4R, thus involved in the development of childhood obesity.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are associated with distinct phenotypes that include mental retardation. Both PWS and AS are caused by loss of function of genes located in chromosome 15q11-q13, an area subject to genomic imprinting. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), based on parent of origin specific DNA methylation at the promoter region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N gene (SNRPN), can provide accurate and rapid diagnosis for nearly all PWS patients while it is less accurate for AS patients. We report the development of a referral system for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS based on M-PCR. Methods: Pediatric geneticists, psychiatrists, or neurologists were asked to evaluate phenotypes of patients with PWS or AS and complete a questionnaire designed according to the consensus criteria to diagnose these conditions. Molecular analysis based on M-PCR was performed for patients with a score of at least two. Results: A total of 108 patients with suspected PWS and 20 patients with suspected AS were referred for diagnostic testing. PWS was diagnosed in 26 of these patients and AS in two. Among the major diagnostic criteria for PWS, excessive weight gain, developmental delay, and hyperphagia were more prevalent in older patients (≥ 1 yr) than in younger patients. Cerebral hypotonia and developmental delay were significantly more prevalent in older PWS patients than in non-PWS patients. Conclusion: M-PCR is a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of PWS and AS. The limitations of current scoring systems and the low cost of M-PCR suggest that routine molecular screening is justified for patients suspected of having PWS.

AB  - There are a few comprehensive genetic studies on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in India. Children of multiple births are valuable for genomics studies of complex disorders such as ASD. We report whole‑exome sequencing (WES) in a triplet family in which only one among the triplet has ASD. The objective of this study was to identify potential candidate genes for ASD. Exome DNA was enriched using a twist human customized core exome kit, and paired‑end sequencing was performed. Proband‑specific de novo variants included 150 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 74 indels. Thirteen SNPs were in exonic regions, 7 of them being missense variations. Seventeen variants were previously reported in ASD. Genes harboring variants have functions in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system and are enriched in biological processes involving cell adhesion. This is the first comprehensive genetic study of a monozygotic triplet in ASD.

AB  - BackgroundPathogenic variants in several genes have been linked to genetic forms of isolated or combined dystonia. The phenotypic and genetic spectrum and the frequency of pathogenic variants in these genes have not yet been fully elucidated, neither in patients with dystonia nor with other, sometimes co-occurring movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).ObjectivesTo screen >2000 patients with dystonia or PD for rare variants in known dystonia-causing genes.MethodsWe screened 1207 dystonia patients from Germany (DysTract consortium), Spain, and South Korea, and 1036 PD patients from Germany for pathogenic variants using a next-generation sequencing gene panel. The impact on DNA methylation of KMT2B variants was evaluated by analyzing the gene's characteristic episignature.ResultsWe identified 171 carriers (109 with dystonia [9.0%]; 62 with PD [6.0%]) of 131 rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.005). A total of 52 patients (48 dystonia [4.0%]; four PD [0.4%, all with GCH1 variants]) carried 33 different (likely) pathogenic variants, of which 17 were not previously reported. Pathogenic biallelic variants in PRKRA were not found. Episignature analysis of 48 KMT2B variants revealed that only two of these should be considered (likely) pathogenic.ConclusionThis study confirms pathogenic variants in GCH1, GNAL, KMT2B, SGCE, THAP1, and TOR1A as relevant causes in dystonia and expands the mutational spectrum. Of note, likely pathogenic variants only in GCH1 were also found among PD patients. For DYT-KMT2B, the recently described episignature served as a reliable readout to determine the functional effect of newly identified variants. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Heightened sensation-seeking is related to the development of delinquency. Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N = 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency.

AB  - Analysis of genomic DNA methylation by generating epigenetic signature profiles (episignatures) is increasingly being implemented in genetic diagnosis. Here we report our experience using episignature analysis to resolve both uncomplicated and complex cases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). We analyzed 97 NDDs divided into (1) a validation cohort of 59 patients with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants characterized by a known episignature and (2) a test cohort of 38 patients harboring variants of unknown significance or unidentified variants. The expected episignature was obtained in most cases with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (53/59 [90%]), a revealing exception being the overlapping profile of two SMARCB1 pathogenic variants with ARID1A/B:c.6200, confirmed by the overlapping clinical features. In the test cohort, five cases showed the expected episignature, including (1) novel pathogenic variants in ARID1B and BRWD3; (2) a deletion in ATRX causing MRXFH1 X-linked mental retardation; and (3) confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Cornelia de Lange (CdL) syndrome in mutation-negative CdL patients. Episignatures analysis of the in BAF complex components revealed novel functional protein interactions and common episignatures affecting homologous residues in highly conserved paralogous proteins (SMARCA2 M856V and SMARCA4 M866V). Finally, we also found sex-dependent episignatures in X-linked disorders. Implementation of episignature profiling is still in its early days, but with increasing utilization comes increasing awareness of the capacity of this methodology to help resolve the complex challenges of genetic diagnoses.

AB  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a genomic imprinting disorder, characterized by macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, lateralized overgrowth, and predisposition to embryonal tumors. It is caused by the defect of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15.5, regulated by imprinting control (IC) domains, IC1, and IC2. Rarely, CDKN1C and chromosomal changes can be detected. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate 55 patients with BWS using the new diagnostic criteria developed by the BWS consensus, and to investigate (epi)genetic changes and follow-up findings in classic and atypical phenotypes. Loss of methylation in IC2 region (IC2-LoM), 11p15.5 paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD11), and methylation gain in IC1 region (IC1-GoM) are detected in 31, eight, and five patients, respectively. Eleven patients have had no molecular defects. Thirty-five patients are classified as classical and 20 as atypical phenotype. Patients with classical phenotype are more frequent in the IC2-LoM (25/31), while patients with atypical phenotype are common in the pUPD11 group (5/8). Malignant tumors have developed in six patients (10.9%); three of these patients have IC1-GoM, two pUPD11, one IC2-LoM genotype, and four an atypical phenotype. We observed that the face was round in the infantile period and elongated as the child grew-up, developing prognathism and becoming asymmetrical if hemi-macroglossia was present in the classical phenotype. These findings were mild in the atypical phenotype. These results support the importance of using the new diagnostic criteria to facilitate the diagnosis of patients with atypical phenotype who have higher tumors risk. This study also provides important information about facial gestalt.

AB  - Childhood allergic diseases, including asthma, rhinitis and eczema, are prevalent conditions that share strong genetic and environmental components. Diagnosis relies on clinical history and measurements of allergen-specific IgE. We hypothesize that a multi-omics model could accurately diagnose childhood allergic disease. We show that nasal DNA methylation has the strongest predictive power to diagnose childhood allergy, surpassing blood DNA methylation, genetic risk scores, and environmental factors. DNA methylation at only three nasal CpG sites classifies allergic disease in Dutch children aged 16 years well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. This is replicated in Puerto Rican children aged 9-20 years (AUC 0.82). DNA methylation at these CpGs additionally detects allergic multimorbidity and symptomatic IgE sensitization. Using nasal single-cell RNA-sequencing data, these three CpGs associate with influx of T cells and macrophages that contribute to allergic inflammation. Our study suggests the potential of methylation-based allergy diagnosis. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Childhood trauma is robustly linked to a broad range of adverse outcomes with consequences persisting far into adulthood. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time. The MRSs have the potential to be a novel clinical biomarker for the assessment of trauma-related health risks. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between early adverse life events and later internalizing problems could be mediated by DNA methylation. Adversity has been associated with higher methylation levels in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in adolescents. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation with adolescents' clinical diagnoses of internalizing disorders and internalizing symptom scores. METHODS: In a population sample (mean age=16.2) we measured DNA methylation in three regions of NR3C1 (NR3C1_1, N=454; NR3C1_2, N=904; NR3C1_3, N=412) and one region of SLC6A4 (N=939) at baseline. Internalizing problems were operationalized as clinical DSM-IV diagnoses, assessed at 3 year follow-up with a diagnostic interview, and internalizing symptom scores, assessed with Self-Report questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Only NR3C1_1 methylation was positively associated with risk of lifetime internalizing disorders, and with symptom scores at follow-up. However, after accounting for baseline symptom scores there was only a tendency for association with internalizing symptom scores at follow-up. There was no association between SLC6A4 methylation and risk of lifetime internalizing disorders. SLC6A4 methylation and internalizing symptom scores showed a tendency for association, also after accounting for baseline symptom scores. LIMITATIONS: There was no repeated measure of DNA methylation to study causality between methylation and internalizing problems. Gene expression data were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Although the role of gene methylation in the development of internalizing problems remains unclear, our findings suggest that gene methylation, particularly of NR3C1, may be involved in the development of internalizing problems in adolescence.

AB  - Purpose: Hao-Fountain syndrome (HAFOUS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in USP7. HAFOUS is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, behavioral abnormalities, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, hypogonadism, and mild dysmorphic features. We investigated the phenotype of 18 participants with HAFOUS and performed DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis, aiming to generate a diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, we performed comparative analysis with known episignatures to gain more insight into the molecular pathophysiology of HAFOUS. Methods: We assessed genomic DNAm profiles of 18 individuals with pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in USP7 to map and validate a specific episignature. The comparison between the USP7 cohort and 56 rare genetic disorders with earlier reported DNAm episignatures was performed with statistical and functional correlation. Results: We mapped a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for pathogenic variants in USP7 and utilized this to reclassify the VUS. Comparative epigenomic analysis showed evidence of HAFOUS similarity to a number of other rare genetic episignature disorders. Conclusion: We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature as a robust diagnostic biomarker for HAFOUS that enables VUS reclassification in USP7. We also expand the phenotypic spectrum of 9 new and 5 previously reported individuals with HAFOUS.

AB  - Clark–Baraitser syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the TRIP12 (Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interactor 12) gene. TRIP12 encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway. The ubiquitin pathway includes activating E1, conjugating E2 and ligating E3 enzymes which regulate the breakdown and sorting of proteins. This enzymatic pathway is crucial for physiological processes. A significant proportion of TRIP12 variants are currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Episignatures have been shown to represent a powerful diagnostic tool to resolve inconclusive genetic findings for Mendelian disorders and to re-classify VUSs. Here, we show the results of DNA methylation episignature analysis in 32 individuals with pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS variants in TRIP12. We identified a specific and sensitive DNA methylation (DNAm) episignature associated with pathogenic TRIP12 variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for Clark–Baraitser syndrome. In addition, we performed analysis of differentially methylated regions as well as functional correlation of the TRIP12 genome-wide methylation profile with the profiles of 56 additional neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Objective: Military servicemen deployed to war zones are at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and successful adaptation to stress is important. Epigenetic alterations in response to trauma have been identified as mechanism of adaptation and may therefore predict deployment-related PTSD symptoms. To date, human studies of epigenetic marks for traumatic stress have been largely constrained by short-term analyses of one or two time points. Method: This study in a prospective Dutch military cohort (N = 125) examined longitudinal changes of DNA methylation profiles before, as well as one and six months after deployment-related combat exposure in relation to the development of PTSD symptoms over a period of up to five years after deployment. We investigated the predictive value of specific methylation changes for immediate and delayed-onset PTSD symptoms and recovery. This epigenetic prediction was compared to polygenic risk score predictions obtained from the currently available largest genome-wide association study of PTSD. Results: A total of fourteen genomic regions were identified in which PTSD symptom levels were associated with methylation changes over time (pre-deployment, one, and six months post-deployment). Of these regions, four were significant determinants of longitudinal development of PTSD symptoms. In addition, we observed that, together with risk level during deployment (operating inside or outside the military base) and physical childhood trauma, post-deployment decreases in methylation at a genomic region in EP300/miRNA1281 was associated with a delayed onset of PTSD compared to a resilient profile. Polygenic risk, in contrast, was related to PTSD onset within six months after deployment but was not associated with long term outcomes. Conclusion: The present study suggests predictive utility of changes in DNA methylation for the subsequent development of PTSD symptoms and showed that the currently available measure of polygenic risk is primarily related to non-delayed disease onset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress exposure during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay may have long-lasting effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants. Altered DNA methylation of stress-related and neurodevelopmentally relevant genes may be an underlying mechanism. AIMS: This exploratory study aimed to investigate the association between neonatal stress exposure and DNA methylation in these genes at two different time points: early during the NICU stay (7-14 days after birth) and later, at discharge from the NICU. SUBJECTS: We included 45 extremely preterm infants in this prospective cohort study, gestational age 24-30 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: We collected fecal samples at days 7-14 (n = 44) and discharge (n = 28) and determined DNA methylation status in predefined regions of NR3C1, SLC6A4, HSD11B2, OPRM1, SLC7A5, SLC1A2, IGF2, NNAT, BDNF and GABRA6 using pyrosequencing. Because of low DNA concentrations in some fecal samples, we could do so in 25-50 % of collected samples. We prospectively quantified daily neonatal stress exposure using the Neonatal Infant Stressor Scale (NISS) and explored associations between cumulative NISS scores and average DNA methylation status. RESULTS: Rates of methylation of most genes were not statistically different between day 7-14 and discharge, except for OPRM1. We found moderately high and mostly negative correlation coefficients upon discharge with the cumulative NISS for the NR3C1, SLC6A4, SLC1A2, IGF2, BDNF and OPRM1 genes, albeit not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that expression of stress-related and neurodevelopmentally relevant genes may be differently regulated following higher neonatal stress exposure. Larger studies should challenge the findings of this study and ideally test the effects on gene expression. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Pathogenic variants in genes involved in the epigenetic machinery are an emerging cause of neurodevelopment disorders (NDDs). Lysine-demethylase 2B (KDM2B) encodes an epigenetic regulator and mouse models suggest an important role during development. We set out to determine whether KDM2B variants are associated with NDD. Methods: Through international collaborations, we collected data on individuals with heterozygous KDM2B variants. We applied methylation arrays on peripheral blood DNA samples to determine a KDM2B associated epigenetic signature. Results: We recruited a total of 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in KDM2B. We present evidence, including a shared epigenetic signature, to support a pathogenic classification of 15 KDM2B variants and identify the CxxC domain as a mutational hotspot. Both loss-of-function and CxxC-domain missense variants present with a specific subepisignature. Moreover, the KDM2B episignature was identified in the context of a dual molecular diagnosis in multiple individuals. Our efforts resulted in a cohort of 21 individuals with heterozygous (likely) pathogenic variants. Individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; congenital organ anomalies mainly of the heart, eyes, and urogenital system; and subtle facial dysmorphism. Conclusion: Pathogenic heterozygous variants in KDM2B are associated with NDD and a specific epigenetic signature detectable in peripheral blood.

AB  - Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable psychiatric disorder. In addition, early life environmental factors contribute to the occurrence of ADHD. Recently, DNA methylation has emerged as a mechanism potentially mediating genetic and environmental effects. Here, we investigated whether newborn DNA methylation patterns of selected candidate genes involved in psychiatric disorders or fetal growth are associated with ADHD symptoms in childhood. Participants were 426 children from a large population based cohort of Dutch national origin. Behavioral data were obtained at age 6 years with the Child Behavior Checklist. For the current study, 11 regions at 7 different genes were selected. DNA methylation levels of cord blood DNA were measured for the 11 regions combined and for each region separately. We examined the association between DNA methylation levels at different regions and ADHD symptoms with linear mixed models. DNA methylation levels were negatively associated with ADHD symptom score in the overall analysis of all 11 regions. This association was largely explained by associations of DRD4 and 5-HTT regions. Other candidate genes showed no association between DNA methylation levels and ADHD symptom score. Associations between DNA methylation levels and ADHD symptom score were attenuated by co-occurring Oppositional defiant disorder and total symptoms. Lower DNA methylation levels of the 7 genes assessed at birth, were associated with more ADHD symptoms of the child at 6 years of age. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to investigate the possible underlying mechanism. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric medulloblastomas are the most frequently diagnosed embryonal tumors of the central nervous system. Current therapies cause severe neurological and cognitive side effects including secondary malignancies. Cellular immunotherapy might be key to improve survival and to avoid morbidity. Efficient killing of tumor cells using immunotherapy requires to overcome cancer-associated strategies to evade cytotoxic immune responses. Here, we examined the immune response and immune evasion strategies in pediatric medulloblastomas. Cytotoxic T-cells, infiltrating medulloblastomas with variable activation status, showed no correlation with overall survival of the patients. We found limited numbers of PD1+ T-cells and complete absence of PD-L1 on medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas downregulated immune recognition molecules MHC-I and CD1 d. Intriguingly, expression of granzyme inhibitors SERPINB1 and SERPINB4 was acquired in 23% and 50% of the tumors, respectively. Concluding, pediatric medulloblastomas exploit multiple immune evasion strategies to overcome immune surveillance. Absence of PD-L1 expression in medulloblastoma suggest limited or no added value for immunotherapy with PD1/PD-L1 blockers.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is a frequent habit sustained by > 1.3 billion people in 2020 and the leading preventable factor for health risk and premature mortality worldwide. In the forensic context, predicting smoking habits from biological samples may allow broadening DNA phenotyping. In this study, we aimed to implement previously published smoking habit classification models based on blood DNA methylation at 13 CpGs. First, we developed a matching lab tool based on bisulfite conversion and multiplex PCR followed by amplification-free library preparation and targeted paired-end massively parallel sequencing (MPS). Analysis of six technical duplicates revealed high reproducibility of methylation measurements (Pearson correlation of 0.983). Artificially methylated standards uncovered marker-specific amplification bias, which we corrected via bi-exponential models. We then applied our MPS tool to 232 blood samples from Europeans of a wide age range, of which 90 were current, 71 former and 71 never smokers. On average, we obtained 189,000 reads/sample and 15,000 reads/CpG, without marker drop-out. Methylation distributions per smoking category roughly corresponded to previous microarray analysis, showcasing large inter-individual variation but with technology-driven bias. Methylation at 11 out of 13 smoking-CpGs correlated with daily cigarettes in current smokers, while solely one was weakly correlated with time since cessation in former smokers. Interestingly, eight smoking-CpGs correlated with age, and one displayed weak but significant sex-associated methylation differences. Using bias-uncorrected MPS data, smoking habits were relatively accurately predicted using both two- (current/non-current) and three- (never/former/current) category model, but bias correction resulted in worse prediction performance for both models. Finally, to account for technology-driven variation, we built new, joint models with inter-technology corrections, which resulted in improved prediction results for both models, with or without PCR bias correction (e.g. MPS cross-validation F1-score > 0.8; 2-categories). Overall, our novel assay takes us one step closer towards the forensic application of viable smoking habit prediction from blood traces. However, future research is needed towards forensically validating the assay, especially in terms of sensitivity. We also need to further shed light on the employed biomarkers, particularly on the mechanistics, tissue specificity and putative confounders of smoking epigenetic signatures.

AB  - Background: To examine methylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) gene and its relationship with child weight status, at birth and 9 years. Methods: We measured PPARγ methylation across 23 CpG sites using the Infinium Illumina 450 k array for children from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort at birth (N = 373) and 9 years (N = 245). Results: Methylation level correlation patterns across the 23 PPARγ CpG sites were conserved between birth and 9-year ages. We found high inter-CpG correlations between sites 1-3 (methylation block 1) and also between sites 18-23 (methylation block 2) for both time points, although these patterns were less pronounced at 9 years. Additionally, sites 1-3 (north shore) had the highest intra-CpG correlations over time (r = 0.24, 0.42, and 0.3; P = 0.002, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). PPARγ methylation levels tended to increase with age, and the largest differences were observed for north shore sites (7.4%). Adjusting for sex, both site 1 and site 20 (gene body) methylation at birth was significantly and inversely associated with birth weight (β =-0.13, P = 0.033; β = -0.09, P = 0.025, respectively). Similarly, we found that site 1 and site 20 methylation at 9 years was significantly and inversely associated with 9-year BMI z-score (β = -0.41, P = 0.015; β = -0.23, P = 0.045, respectively). Conclusion: Our results indicate that PPARγ methylation is highly organized and conserved over time, and highlight the potential functional importance of north shore sites, adding to a better understanding of regional human methylome patterns. Overall, our results suggest that PPARγ methylation may be associated with child body size.

AB  - Chung-Jansen syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity and dysmorphic features. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the PHIP gene that encodes for the Pleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein, which is part of an epigenetic modifier protein complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHIP haploinsufficiency may impact genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the DNAm profiles of affected individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic PHIP variants with Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays and report a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature biomarker for Chung-Jansen syndrome. In addition, we observed similarities between the methylation profile of Chung-Jansen syndrome and that of functionally related and clinically partially overlapping genetic disorders, White-Kernohan syndrome (caused by variants in DDB1 gene) and Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (caused by variants in PHF6 gene). Based on these observations we also proceeded to develop a common episignature biomarker for these disorders. These newly defined episignatures can be used as part of a multiclass episignature classifier for screening of affected individuals with rare disorders and interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance, and provide further insights into the common molecular pathophysiology of the clinically-related Chung-Jansen, Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann and White-Kernohan syndromes.

AB  - Accurate diagnosis for patients living with neurodevelopmental disorders is often met with numerous challenges, related to the ambiguity of findings and lack of specificity in genetic variants leading to pathology. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has been used to develop highly sensitive and specific 'episignatures' as biomarkers capable of differentiating and classifying complex neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study we describe distinct episignatures for KAT6A syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in the lysine acetyltransferase A gene (KAT6A), and for the two neurodevelopmental disorders associated with lysine acetyl transferase B (KAT6B). We demonstrate the ability of our models to differentiate between highly overlapping episignatures, increasing the ability to effectively identify and diagnose these conditions.

AB  - Background: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterised by intrauterine growth restriction, poor postnatal growth, relative macrocephaly, triangular face and asymmetry. Maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) of chromosome 7 and hypomethylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) 1 on chromosome 11p15 are found in 5-10% and up to 60% of patients with SRS, respectively. As many features are non-specific, diagnosis of SRS remains difficult. Studies of patients in whom the molecular diagnosis is confirmed therefore provide valuable clinical information on the condition. Methods: A detailed, prospective study of 64 patients with mUPD7 (n=20) or ICR1 hypomethylation (n=44) was undertaken. Results and conclusions: The considerable overlap in clinical phenotype makes it difficult to distinguish these two molecular subgroups reliably. ICR1 hypomethylation was more likely to be scored as 'classical' SRS. Asymmetry, fifth finger clinodactyly and congenital anomalies were more commonly seen with ICR1 hypomethylation, whereas learning difficulties and referral for speech therapy were more likely with mUPD7. Myoclonus-dystonia has been reported previously in one mUPD7 patient. The authors report mild movement disorders in three further cases. No correlation was found between clinical severity and level of ICR1 hypomethylation. Use of assisted reproductive technology in association with ICR1 hypomethylation seems increased compared with the general population. ICR1 hypomethylation was also observed in affected siblings, although recurrence risk remains low in the majority of cases. Overall, a wide range of severity was observed, particularly with ICR1 hypomethylation. A low threshold for investigation of patients with features suggestive, but not typical, of SRS is therefore recommended.

AB  - Background:The ratio between amygdala:hippocampal (AH) volume has been associated with multiple psychiatric problems, including anxiety and aggression. Yet, little is known about its biological underpinnings. Here, we used a methylome-wide approach to test (a) whether DNA methylation in early life (birth, age 7) prospectively associates with total AH volume ratio in early adulthood, and (b) whether significant DNA methylation markers are influenced by prenatal risk factors. Methods: Analyses were based on a subsample (n=109 males) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which included measures of prenatal risk, DNA methylation (Infinium Illumina 450k), T1-weighted brain scans and psychopathology in early adulthood (age 18-21). Amygdala and hippocampus measures were derived using Freesurfer 5.3.0. Methylation markers related to AH volume ratio across time were identified using longitudinal multilevel modeling. Results: Amygdala:hippocampal volume ratio correlated positively with age 18 psychosis-like symptoms (p=.007). Methylation of a probe in the gene SP6 associated longitudinally with (a) higher AH volume ratio (FDR q-value=.01) and (b) higher stressful life events during pregnancy (p=.046). SP6 is expressed in the hippocampus and amygdala and has been implicated in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The association between SP6 DNA methylation, AH volume ratio and psychopathology was replicated in an independent dataset of 101 patients with schizophrenia and 111 healthy controls. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that epigenetic alterations in genes implicated in neurodevelopment may contribute to a brain-based biomarker of psychopathology.

AB  - Background: Incorporating genomic data into risk prediction has become an increasingly useful approach for rapid identification of individuals most at risk for complex disorders such as PTSD. Our goal was to develop and validate Methylation Risk Scores (MRS) using machine learning to distinguish individuals who have PTSD from those who do not. Methods: Elastic Net was used to develop three risk score models using a discovery dataset (n = 1226; 314 cases, 912 controls) comprised of 5 diverse cohorts with available blood-derived DNA methylation (DNAm) measured on the Illumina Epic BeadChip. The first risk score, exposure and methylation risk score (eMRS) used cumulative and childhood trauma exposure and DNAm variables; the second, methylation-only risk score (MoRS) was based solely on DNAm data; the third, methylation-only risk scores with adjusted exposure variables (MoRSAE) utilized DNAm data adjusted for the two exposure variables. The potential of these risk scores to predict future PTSD based on pre-deployment data was also assessed. External validation of risk scores was conducted in four independent cohorts. Results: The eMRS model showed the highest accuracy (92%), precision (91%), recall (87%), and f1-score (89%) in classifying PTSD using 3730 features. While still highly accurate, the MoRS (accuracy = 89%) using 3728 features and MoRSAE (accuracy = 84%) using 4150 features showed a decline in classification power. eMRS significantly predicted PTSD in one of the four independent cohorts, the BEAR cohort (beta = 0.6839, p-0.003), but not in the remaining three cohorts. Pre-deployment risk scores from all models (eMRS, beta = 1.92; MoRS, beta = 1.99 and MoRSAE, beta = 1.77) displayed a significant (p < 0.001) predictive power for post-deployment PTSD. Conclusion: Results, especially those from the eMRS, reinforce earlier findings that methylation and trauma are interconnected and can be leveraged to increase the correct classification of those with vs. without PTSD. Moreover, our models can potentially be a valuable tool in predicting the future risk of developing PTSD. As more data become available, including additional molecular, environmental, and psychosocial factors in these scores may enhance their accuracy in predicting the condition and, relatedly, improve their performance in independent cohorts.

AB  - Multiple studies have shown that DNA methylation (DNAm) models of protein abundance can be informative about exposure, phenotype and disease risk. Here we investigate and provide descriptive details of the capacity of DNAm to capture non-genetic variation in protein abundance across the lifecourse. We evaluated the performance of 14 previously published DNAm models of protein abundance (episcores) in peripheral blood from a large adult population using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at ages 7–24 and their mothers antenatally and in middle age (N range = 145–1464). New age-specific episcores were trained in ALSPAC and evaluated at different ages. In all instances, episcore–protein associations were evaluated with and without adjustment for genetics. The association between longitudinal protein stability and longitudinal episcore projection was also evaluated, as was sex-specificity of episcores derived solely in female participants. Of the 14 Gadd episcores, 10 generated estimates associated with abundance in middle age, 9 at age 24, and none at age 9. Eight of these episcores explained variation beyond genotype in adulthood (6 at age 24; 7 at midlife). At age 9, the abundances of 22 proteins could be modelled by DNAm, 7 beyond genotype of which one trained model generated informative estimates at ages 24 and in middle age. At age 24, 31 proteins could be modelled by DNAm, 19 beyond genotype, of which 5 trained models generated informative estimates at age 9 and 8 in middle age. In middle age, 23 proteins could be modelled, 13 beyond genotype, of which 3 were informative at age 9 and 7 at age 24. We observed that episcores performed better at older ages than in children with several episcores capturing non-genetic variation at all ages.

AB  - Floating-Harbor syndrome (FLHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by truncating variants in exons 33 and 34 of the SNF2-related CREBBP activator protein gene (SRCAP). Truncating variants proximal to this location in SRCAP result in a non-FLHS SRCAP-associated NDD; an overlapping but distinct NDD characterized by developmental delay with or without intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, normal stature, and behavioral and psychiatric issues. Here, we report a young woman who initially presented in childhood with significant delays in speech and mild ID. In young adulthood, she developed schizophrenia. On physical examination, she had facial features suggestive of 22q11 deletion syndrome. After non-diagnostic chromosomal microarray and trio exome sequencing (ES), a re-analysis of trio ES data identified a de novo missense variant in SRCAP that was proximal to the FLHS critical region. Subsequent DNA methylation studies showed the unique methylation signature associated with pathogenic sequence variants in non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD. This clinical report describes an individual with non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD caused by an SRCAP missense variant, and it also demonstrates the clinical utility of ES re-analysis and DNA methylation analysis for undiagnosed patients, in particular, those with variants of uncertain significance.

AB  - DNA methylation is known as a biomarker for age with applications in forensics. Here we describe the VISAGE (VISible Attributes through GEnomics) Consortium's enhanced tool for epigenetic age estimation in somatic tissues. The tool is based on eight DNA methylation markers (44 CpGs), bisulfite multiplex PCR followed by sequencing on the MiSeq FGx platform, and three statistical prediction models for blood, buccal cells and bones. The model for blood is based on six CpGs from ELOVL2, MIR29B2CHG, KLF14, FHL2, TRIM59 and PDE4C, and predicts age with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.2 years, while the model for buccal cells includes five CpGs from PDE4C, MIR29B2CHG, ELOVL2, KLF14 and EDARADD and predicts age with MAE of 3.7 years, and the model for bones has six CpGs from ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C and ASPA and predicts age with MAE of 3.4 years. The VISAGE enhanced tool for age estimation in somatic tissues enables reliable collection of DNA methylation data from small amounts of DNA using a sensitive multiplex MPS assay that provides accurate estimation of age in blood, buccal swabs, and bones using the statistical model tailored to each tissue.

AB  - Rationale: Little is known about effects of paternal tobacco smoke (PTS) on the offspring's asthma and its prenatal epigenetic programming. Objective: To investigate whether PTS exposure was associated with the offspring's asthma and correlated to epigenetic CG methylation of potential tobacco-related immune genes: LMO2, GSTM1 or/and IL-10 genes. Measurements and Main Results: In a birth cohort of 1,629 newborns, we measured exposure rates of PTS (23%) and maternal tobacco smoke (MTS, 0.2%), cord blood DNA methylation, infant respiratory tract infection, childhood DNA methylation, and childhood allergic diseases. Infants with prenatal PTS exposure had a significantly higher risk of asthma by the age of 6 than those without (p = 0.026). The PTS exposure doses at 0, <20, and >= 20 cigarettes per day were significantly associated with the trend of childhood asthma and the increase of LMO2-E148 (p = 0.006), and IL10_P325 (p = 0.008) CG methylation. The combination of higher CG methylation levels of LMO2 E148, IL10_P325, and GSTM1 _P266 corresponded to the highest risk of asthma by 43.48%, compared to other combinations (16.67-23.08%) in the 3-way multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The LM02_P794 and GSTM1 _P266 CG methylation levels at age 0 were significantly correlated to those at age of 6. Conclusions: Prenatal PTS exposure increases CG methylation contents of immune genes, such as LMO2 and IL-10, which significantly retained from newborn stage to 6 years of age and correlated to development of childhood asthma. Modulation of the LMO2 and IL-10 CG methylation and/or their gene expression may provide a regimen for early prevention of PTS-associated childhood asthma. Descriptor number: 1.10 Asthma Mediators. Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: It has been better known that maternal tobacco smoke (MTS) has an impact on the offspring's asthma via epigenetic modification. Little is known about effects of paternal tobacco smoke (PTS) on the offspring's asthma and its prenatal epigenetic programming. What This Study Adds to the Field: Prenatal tobacco smoke (PTS) can program epigenetic modifications in certain genes, such as LMO2 and IL-10, and that these modifications are correlated to childhood asthma development. The higher the PTS exposure dose the higher the CG methylation levels are found. The combination of higher CG methylation levels of LMO2 E148, IL10_P325 and GSTM1_P266 corresponded to the highest risk of asthma. Measuring the DNA methylation levels of certain genes might help to predict high-risk populations for childhood asthma and provide a potential target to prevent the development of childhood asthma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rare genetic variants in the PURA gene cause the PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder (PURA-NDD), characterized by neonatal abnormalities and developmental delay. Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on patients with PURA variants, we aim to establish a PURA-NDD-specific methylation profile and provide further insights on the molecular basis of the PURA-NDD. METHODS: Twenty three individuals (including 12 unpublished) carrying PURA variants were enrolled. We conducted the Illumina Infinium EPIC microarray analysis in 17 PURA-NDD individuals. In vitro experiments were performed to examine how PURA variants affect Pur-a expression. RESULTS: Additional phenotypes in 12 newly identified patients were described in this study. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis unveiled distinctive methylation profiles to PURA-NDD, and the established classifier can reclassify PURA variants of uncertain significance. Patients bearing PURA hapoloinsufficient and missense variants have comparable DNA methylation profiles, and cells expressing these PURA variants showed consistent Pur-a downregulation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism. CONCLUSION: Patients with PURA-NDD exhibit a specific episignature, which has potential to aid identification and diagnosis of PURA-NDD patients and offer implications for further functional investigations.

AB  - AIMS: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal epilepsy syndrome in adults and frequently develops drug resistance. Studies have investigated the value of peripheral DNA methylation signature as molecular biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis. We aimed to explore methylation biomarkers for TLE diagnosis and pharmacoresistance prediction. METHODS: We initially conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in TLE patients, and then selected candidate CpGs in training cohort and validated in another independent cohort by employing machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, nomogram comprising DNA methylation and clinicopathological data was generated to predict the drug response in the entire patient cohort. Lastly, bioinformatics analysis for CpG-associated genes was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: After screening and validation, eight CpGs were identified for diagnostic biomarker with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 and six CpGs for drug-resistant prediction biomarker with an AUC of 0.79. The nomogram for drug-resistant prediction comprised methylation risk score, disease course, seizure frequency, and hippocampal sclerosis, with AUC as high as 0.96. Bioinformatics analysis indicated drug response-related CpGs corresponding genes closely related to DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to use peripheral DNA methylation signature as molecular biomarker for epilepsy diagnosis and drug-resistant prediction. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Epigenetics refers to the study of clonally inherited changes in gene expression without accompanying genetic changes. Previous research on the epigenetics of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly focused on the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as a result of DNA methylation. However, the basic molecular pathogenesis of epigenetics in MDS remains poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed that DNA methylation and histone modification may be controlled by Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins, which may give new clues toward understanding the epigenetic mechanism of MDS. In this study, we explored for the first time the expression of PcG genes, including EZH2, EED, SUZ12, RING1, and BMI1, in various MDS subsets and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as the relationship between the expression of PcG genes and epigenetic alteration and prognosis-risk scoring. Patients with MDS/AML showed overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes compared to their expression levels in patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases. The MDS patients with DNA methylation had higher EZH2 expression than those without DNA methylation. The patients who received decitabine treatment presented significantly reduced expression of EZH2 and RING1 besides decreased p15INK4B methylation after decitabine treatment. Moreover, overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 was always linked to poor prognostic scoring. In conclusion, overexpression of the EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes is common in MDS and indicate poor prognosis. The products of these genes might participate in epigenetic regulation of MDS. These studies may also contribute to our understanding of the effective mechanism of decitabine. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: A greatly growing body of literature has revealed the mediating role of DNA methylation in the influence path from childhood maltreatment to psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult. However, the statistical method is challenging and powerful mediation analyses regarding this issue are lacking. Methods: To study how the maltreatment in childhood alters long-lasting DNA methylation changes which further affect PTSD in adult, we here carried out a gene-based mediation analysis from a perspective of composite null hypothesis in the Grady Trauma Project (352 participants and 16,565 genes) with childhood maltreatment as exposure, multiple DNA methylation sites as mediators, and PTSD or its relevant scores as outcome. We effectively addressed the challenging issue of gene-based mediation analysis by taking its composite null hypothesis testing nature into consideration and fitting a weighted test statistic. Results: We discovered that childhood maltreatment could substantially affected PTSD or PTSD-related scores, and that childhood maltreatment was associated with DNA methylation which further had significant roles in PTSD and these scores. Furthermore, using the proposed mediation method, we identified multiple genes within which DNA methylation sites exhibited mediating roles in the influence path from childhood maltreatment to PTSD-relevant scores in adult, with 13 for Beck Depression Inventory and 6 for modified PTSD Symptom Scale, respectively. Conclusion: Our results have the potential to confer meaningful insights into the biological mechanism for the impact of early adverse experience on adult diseases; and our proposed mediation methods can be applied to other similar analysis settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parental smoking is implicated in the etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer. We recently reported an association between an epigenetic biomarker of early-life tobacco smoke exposure at the AHRR gene and increased frequency of somatic gene deletions among ALL cases. METHODS: Here, we further assess this association using two epigenetic biomarkers for maternal smoking during pregnancy-DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and a recently established polyepigenetic smoking score-in an expanded set of 482 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases in the California Childhood Leukemia Study with available Illumina 450K or MethylationEPIC array data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the associations between the epigenetic biomarkers and gene deletion numbers. RESULTS: We found an association between DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion number among 284 childhood B-ALL cases with MethylationEPIC array data, with a ratio of means (RM) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.69] for each 0.1 beta value reduction in DNA methylation, an effect size similar to our previous report in an independent set of 198 B-ALL cases with 450K array data [meta-analysis summary RM (sRM) = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57]. The polyepigenetic smoking score was positively associated with gene deletion frequency among all 482 B-ALL cases (sRM = 1.31 for each 4-unit increase in score; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence that prenatal tobacco-smoke exposure may influence the generation of somatic copy-number deletions in childhood B-ALL. IMPACT: Analyses of deletion breakpoint sequences are required to further understand the mutagenic effects of tobacco smoke in childhood ALL.

AB  - Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignant tumor in young men aged 20-34 years. Currently, the diagnosis and differentiation of TGCTs depend on immunohistochemical analysis, and the treatment methods are mainly surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Although immunotherapy has been applied in clinic, the response rate is not high, and also there is a lack of effective biomarkers. In this study, through high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and public data mining, the expression of hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2) was found to be significantly upregulated in TGCT tissue and correlated with poor prognosis. Additionally, the expression level of HAVCR2 was negatively correlated with its DNA methylation but positively correlated with its copy number level. The HAVCR2 expression level was significantly positively correlated with the infiltration of six types of immune cells, including B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells. Also, the higher its expression level, the higher the immune cell abundance. Tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) scoring analysis showed that HAVCR2 was related to the responsiveness to TGCT immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that HAVCR2 was related to the sensitivity of multiple antitumor drugs. This study demonstrated that HAVCR2 has high potential as a biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of TGCTs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study were to compare early predictive marker of the metabolic syndrome with proopiomelanocortin (POMC)methylation status and to determine the association among birth weight, ponderal index, and cord blood methylation status. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Wecollected pregnancy outcome data frompregnant women, cord blood samples at delivery, and blood from children (7-9 years old; n = 90) through a prospective cohort study at EwhaWomans University, MokDong Hospital (Seoul, Korea), from 2003-2005. POMC methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing. We divided subjects into three groups according to cord blood POMC methylation: the low methylation (<10th percentile), mid-methylation, and high methylation (>90th percentile) groups. We analyzed the association of POMC methylation status at birthwith adiposity andmetabolic components using ANCOVA andmultiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS Birth weights (P = 0.01) and ponderal indices (P = 0.01) in the high POMC methylation group were significantly lower than in the mid-POMC methylation group. In terms of metabolic components of childhood, blood triglycerides (57.97, 67.29 vs. 113.89mg/dL; P = 0.03, 0.01) and insulin (7.10, 7.64 vs. 10.13 mIU/mL; P = 0.05, 0.02) at childhood were significantly higher in the high POMC methylation group than in the low and mid-POMC methylation group. CONCLUSIONS High POMC methylation in cord blood was associatedwith lower birthweight, and children with high POMC methylation in cord blood showed higher triglycerides and higher insulin concentrations in blood. Thus, POMCmethylation status in cord blood may be an early predictive marker of future metabolic syndrome. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Background and objectives: Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient enzymatic activity of N-acetyl galactosamine-4-sulphatase, which is caused by mutations in the arylsulphatase B (ARSB) gene. To date, 163 different types of mutations in the ARSB have been reported. However, the full mutation spectrum in the MPS VI phenotype is still not known. The aim of this study was to perform molecular testing of the ARSB gene in the patient and his family members to confirm MPS VI. Methods: Molecular characterisation of the ARSB gene was performed using Sanger sequencing. We studied a child suspected of having MPS VI and 16 other relatives. Results: We identified a C-to-T transition resulting in an exchange of the Arg codon 160 for a premature stop codon (R160*, in exon 2). The transition was in CpG dinucleotides. Interpretation and conclusions: The study provided some insights into the genotype-phenotype relationship in MPS VI and the importance of genetic testing when diagnosing MPS, which is not a mandatory test for the diagnosis and only very occasionally performed. Additionally, we present here the history of a family with confirmed MPS VI, which is extremely rare especially in south-eastern Poland. What is more, the position where the mutation is located is very interesting because it is the region of CpG, which is the site of the methylation process. Thus, this opens the possibility of a new approach indicating the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism that should be examined in the context of the pathomechanism of MPS.

AB  - Background: More reliable clinical outcome prediction is required to better guide more personalized treatment for patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The objective of this study was to identify a microRNA expression signature to improve outcome prediction for patients with primary GBM. METHODS: A cohort of Chinese patients with primary GBM (n = 82) was analyzed using whole-genome microRNA expression profiling with patients divided into a training set and a testing set. Cox regression and risk-score analyses were used to develop a 5-microRNA signature using 41 training samples. The signature was validated in 41 other test samples, in an independent cohort of 35 patients with GBM, and in the Cancer Genome Atlas data set. RESULTS: Patients who had high risk scores according to the 5-microRNA signature had poor overall survival and progression-free survival compared with patients who had low risk scores. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the 5-microRNA signature was an independent prognostic biomarker after adjusting for other clinicopathologic and genetic factors, such as extent of resection, temozolomide chemotherapy, preoperative Karnofsky performance status score, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-microRNA signature was identified as an independent risk predictor that identified patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome, demonstrating its potential for personalizing cancer management. The authors concluded that this signature should be evaluated in further prospective studies. © 2012 American Cancer Society.

AB  - Background: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a common pediatric malignancy in children younger than 15 years old. Although the overall survival (OS) has been improved in recent years, the mechanisms of AML remain largely unknown. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore the differentially methylated genes and to investigate the underlying mechanism in AML initiation and progression based on the bioinformatic analysis. Methods: Methylation array data and gene expression data were obtained from TARGET Data Matrix. The consensus clustering analysis was performed using ConsensusClusterPlus R package. The global DNA methylation was analyzed using methylationArrayAnalysis R package and differentially methylated genes (DMGs), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Limma R package. Besides, the biological function was analyzed using clusterProfiler R package. The correlation between DMGs and DEGs was determined using psych R package. Moreover, the correlation between DMGs and AML was assessed using varElect online tool. And the overall survival and progression-free survival were analyzed using survival R package. Results: All AML samples in this study were divided into three clusters at k = 3. Based on consensus clustering, we identified 1,146 CpGs, including 40 hypermethylated and 1,106 hypomethylated CpGs in AML. Besides, a total 529 DEGs were identified, including 270 upregulated and 259 downregulated DEGs in AML. The function analysis showed that DEGs significantly enriched in AML related biological process. Moreover, the correlation between DMGs and DEGs indicated that seven DMGs directly interacted with AML. CD34, HOXA7, and CD96 showed the strongest correlation with AML. Further, we explored three CpG sites cg03583857, cg26511321, cg04039397 of CD34, HOXA7, and CD96 which acted as the clinical prognostic biomarkers. Conclusion: Our study identified three novel methylated genes in AML and also explored the mechanism of methylated genes in AML. Our finding may provide novel potential prognostic markers for AML.

AB  - Importance: Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy has been associated with various health consequences, including suboptimal neurodevelopment in offspring. However, the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking on child brain development has yet to be elucidated. Objective: To investigate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring brain development in preadolescence as well as the mediating pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis. Exposures: Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score. Results: The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring.

AB  - The estimation of chronological age from biological fluids has been an important quest for forensic scientists worldwide, with recent approaches exploiting the variability of DNA methylation patterns with age in order to develop the next generation of forensic 'DNA intelligence' tools for this application. Drawing from the conclusions of previous work utilising massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for this analysis, this work introduces a DNA methylation-based age estimation method for blood that exhibits the best combination of prediction accuracy and sensitivity reported to date. Statistical evaluation of markers from 51 studies using microarray data from over 4000 individuals, followed by validation using in-house generated MPS data, revealed a final set of 11 markers with the greatest potential for accurate age estimation from minimal DNA material. Utilising an algorithm based on support vector machines, the proposed model achieved an average error (MAE) of 3.3 years, with this level of accuracy retained down to 5 ng of starting DNA input (~ 1 ng PCR input). The accuracy of the model was retained (MAE = 3.8 years) in a separate test set of 88 samples of Spanish origin, while predictions for donors of greater forensic interest (< 55 years of age) displayed even higher accuracy (MAE = 2.6 years). Finally, no sex-related bias was observed for this model, while there were also no signs of variation observed between control and disease-associated populations for schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, frontal temporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy in microarray data relating to the 11 markers.

AB  - The incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally but their causes are generally not understood. Here we show that cumulative ancestral stress leads to premature aging and raises NCD risk in a rat population. This longitudinal study revealed that cumulative multigenerational prenatal stress (MPS) across four generations (F0-F3) raises age- and sex-dependent adverse health outcomes in F4 offspring. MPS accelerated biological aging processes and exacerbated sex-specific incidences of respiratory and kidney diseases, inflammatory processes and tumors. Unbiased deep sequencing of frontal cortex revealed that MPS altered expression of microRNAs and their target genes involved in synaptic plasticity, stress regulation, immune function and longevity. Multi-layer top-down deep learning metabolite enrichment analysis of urine markers revealed altered metabolic homeodynamics in MPS males. Thus, peripheral metabolic signatures may provide sensitive biomarkers of stress vulnerability and disease risk. Programming by MPS appears to be a significant determinant of lifetime mental health trajectories, physical wellbeing and vulnerability to NCDs through altered epigenetic regulation.

AB  - Gestational epigenetic aging (GEA) is a novel approach for characterizing associations between prenatal exposures and postnatal risks. Psychosocial adversity in pregnancy may influence GEA, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. DNA methylation to glucocorticoid regulation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes are implicated but have not been fully examined in association with GEA. This study investigated whether a polyepigenetic glucocorticoid exposure score (PGES) and HPA axis gene (NR3C1, HSD11B2, FKBP5) methylation were associated with GEA, and whether associations were sex-specific. Participants were from a prospective cohort of racial/ethnic diverse and socially disadvantaged pregnant women and infants (n = 200). DNA methylation variables were estimated using umbilical cord blood. PGES was derived with CpGs shown to be sensitive to synthetic dexamethasone exposure. NR3C1, HSD11B2, and FKBP5 methylation was summarized via factor analysis. We found that PGES (beta = -1.12, SE = 0.47, p = 0.02) and several NR3C1 and FKBP5 factor scores were associated with decelerated GEA (all p < 0.05). A significant sex interaction was observed for FKBP5 factor score 3 (beta = -0.34, SE = 0.15, p = 0.02) suggesting decelerated GEA for males but not females. This study showed that glucocorticoid regulation-related DNA methylation was associated with a decelerated aging phenotype at birth that might indicate a neonatal risk.

AB  - The prediction of the chronological age of a deceased individual at time of death can provide important information in case of unidentified bodies. The methodological possibilities in these cases depend on the availability of tissues, whereby bones are preserved for a long time due to their mineralization under normal environmental conditions. Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) as well as the accumulation of pentosidine (Pen) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) could be useful molecular markers for age prediction. A combination of such molecular clocks into one age prediction model seems favorable to minimize inter- and intra-individual variation. We therefore developed (I) age prediction models based on the three molecular clocks, (II) examined the improvement of age prediction by combination, and (III) investigated if samples with signs of decomposition can also be examined using these three molecular clocks. Skull bone from deceased individuals was collected to obtain a training dataset (n = 86), and two independent test sets (without signs of decomposition: n = 44, with signs of decomposition: n = 48). DNAm of 6 CpG sites in ELOVL2, KLF14, PDE4C, RPA2, TRIM59 and ZYG11A was analyzed using massive parallel sequencing (MPS). The D-Asp and Pen contents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Age prediction models based on ridge regression were developed resulting in mean absolute errors (MAEs)/root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.5years /6.6 years (DNAm), 7.7 years /9.3 years (Pen) and 11.7 years /14.6 years (D-Asp) in the test set. Unsurprisingly, a general lower accuracy for the DNAm, D-Asp, and Pen models was observed in samples from decomposed bodies (MAE: 7.4-11.8 years, RMSE: 10.4-15.4 years). This reduced accuracy could be caused by multiple factors with different impact on each molecular clock. To acknowledge general changes due to decomposition, a pilot model for a possible age prediction based on the decomposed samples as training set improved the accuracy evaluated by leave-one-out-cross validation (MAE: 6.6-12 years, RMSE: 8.1-15.9 years). The combination of all three molecular age clocks did reveal comparable MAE and RMSE results to the pure analysis of the DNA methylation for the test set without signs of decomposition. However, an improvement by the combination of all three clocks was possible for the decomposed samples, reducing especially the deviation in case of outliers in samples with very high decomposition and low DNA content. The results demonstrate the general potential in a combined analysis of different molecular clocks in specific cases.

AB  - Childhood behavioural problems pose long-term mental health risks, yet the biological basis of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms remains unclear. In a cohort of 40,212 children, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic scores (PGS), and DNA methylation profiling (EWAS) to examine the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of internalizing, externalizing, and co-occurring problems. All outcomes showed modest SNP-based heritability (h2 = 0.02–0.19, FDR < 0.05). GWAS identified a significant locus for co-occurring problems at age five (rs73161798, p = 3.26 × 10-8), near USP12, a gene implicated in neuroplasticity and risk-taking. PGS for co-occurring symptoms was associated with higher neuroticism and lower cognitive ability. DNA methylation explained substantial variance in co-occurring problems at ages three (R2 = 0.19) and five (R2 = 0.62), but not in single-domain symptoms. EWAS revealed 101 significant sites (p < 10-7) linked to neurodevelopmental, immune, and metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that co-occurring behavioural problems have a distinct, age-sensitive biological architecture.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error through recall bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalized linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - FBRSL1, together with FBRS and AUTS2 (Activator of Transcription and Developmental Regulator; OMIM 607270), constitutes a tripartite AUTS2 gene family. AUTS2 and FBRSL1 are evolutionarily more closely related to each other than to FBRS (Fibrosin 1; OMIM 608601). Despite its paralogous relation to AUTS2, FBRSL1's precise role remains unclear, though it likely shares functions in neurogenesis and transcriptional regulation. Herein, we report the clinical presentation with therapeutic approaches and the molecular etiology of a patient harboring a de novo truncating variant (c.371dupC) in FBRSL1, leading to a premature stop codon (p.Cys125Leufs*7). Our study extends previous knowledge by highlighting potential interactions and implications of this variant, alongside maternal and paternal duplications, for the patient's phenotype. Using sequence conservation data and in silico analysis of the truncated protein, we generated a predicted domain structure. Furthermore, our in silico analysis was extended by taking into account SNP array results. The extension of in silico analysis was performed due to the possibility that the coexistence of FBRSL1 truncating variant contemporary with maternal and paternal duplication could be a modifier of proband's phenotype and/or influence the novel syndrome clinical characteristics. FBRSL1 protein may be involved in neurodevelopment due to its homology with AUTS2, together with distinctive neuronal expression profiles, and thus should be considered as a potential modulation of clinical characteristics in a novel syndrome. Finally, considering that FBRSL1 is apparently involved in neurogenesis and in transcriptional regulatory networks that orchestrate gene expression, together with the observation that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns, the specific episignature has been explored.

AB  - Massively parallel sequencing, also referred to as next-generation sequencing, has positively changed DNA analysis, allowing further advances in genetics. Its capability of dealing with low quantity/damaged samples makes it an interesting instrument for forensics. The main advantage of MPS is the possibility of analyzing simultaneously thousands of genetic markers, generating high-resolution data. Its detailed sequence information allowed the discovery of variations in core forensic short tandem repeat loci, as well as the identification of previous unknown polymorphisms. Furthermore, different types of markers can be sequenced in a single run, enabling the emergence of DIP-STRs, SNP-STR haplotypes, and microhaplotypes, which can be very useful in mixture deconvolution cases. In addition, the multiplex analysis of different single nucleotide polymorphisms can provide valuable information about identity, biogeographic ancestry, paternity, or phenotype. DNA methylation patterns, mitochondrial DNA, mRNA, and microRNA profiling can also be analyzed for different purposes, such as age inference, maternal lineage analysis, body-fluid identification, and monozygotic twin discrimination. MPS technology also empowers the study of metagenomics, which analyzes genetic material from a microbial community to obtain information about individual identification, post-mortem interval estimation, geolocation inference, and substrate analysis. This review aims to discuss the main applications of MPS in forensic genetics.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) comprise clinical conditions with high genetic heterogeneity and a notable enrichment of genes involved in regulating chromatin structure and function. The EHMT1/2 epigenetic complex plays a crucial role in repression of gene transcription in a highly tissue- and temporal-specific manner. Mutations resulting in heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) of EHMT1 are implicated in Kleefstra syndrome 1 (KS1). EHMT2 is a gene acting in epigenetic regulation; however, the involvement of mutations in this gene in the etiology of NDDs has not been established thus far. A homozygous EHMT2 LoF variant [(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G] was identified by exome sequencing in an adult female patient with a phenotype resembling KS1, presenting with intellectual disability, aggressive behavior, facial dysmorphisms, fused C2-C3 vertebrae, ventricular septal defect, supernumerary nipple, umbilical hernia, and fingers and toes abnormalities. The absence of homozygous LoF EHMT2 variants in population databases underscores the significant negative selection pressure exerted on these variants. In silico evaluation of the effect of the EHMT2(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G variant predicted the abolishment of intron 3 splice donor site. However, manual inspection revealed potential cryptic donor splice sites at this EHMT2 region. To directly access the impact of this splice site variant, RNAseq analysis was employed and disclosed the usage of two cryptic donor sites within exon 3 in the patient’s blood, which are predicted to result in either an out-of-frame or in-frame effect on the protein. Methylation analysis was conducted on DNA from blood samples using the clinically validated EpiSign assay, which revealed that the patient with the homozygous EHMT2(NM_006709.5):c.328 + 2 T > G splice site variant is conclusively positive for the KS1 episignature. Taken together, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic data pointed to a LoF mechanism for the EHMT2 splice variant and support this gene as a novel candidate for an autosomal recessive Kleefstra-like syndrome. The identification of additional cases with deleterious EHMT2 variants, alongside further functional validation studies, is required to substantiate EHMT2 as a novel NDD gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) investigating the association between DNA methylation (DNAm) and child neurodevelopment have been predominantly conducted within Western populations, and yielded inconsistent results, leading to a significant gap within non-Western setting, particularly in resource-limited rural areas of Central China. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between altered epigenome-wide DNAm and neurodevelopment in preschool children from resource-limited rural areas of Central China. METHODS: This case-control study involved 64 preschoolers. We assessed children's neurodevelopment using the Gesell Developmental Diagnostic Scale. The neurodevelopmental potential was expressed as a global developmental quotient (DQ) score. We conducted an EWAS with an Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip array, using blood samples from 32 suspected developmental delay children (DQ scores < 85) and 32 controls (DQ scores >= 85). Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the suspected developmental delay and control groups were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between global DQ scores and DNAm. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The BECon tool was utilized to estimate the concordance of CpGs between blood and the human brain. RESULTS: A total of 66 DMRs (PFDR < 0.05) were identified between the two groups, but no DMPs were found. After FDR correction, 844 methylated CpG sites exhibited significant associations with the global DQ scores in children. Genes annotated by methylated CpGs were mainly enriched in the "oxytocin signaling pathway", "mTOR signaling pathway", and "thyroid hormone signaling pathway". They were also involved in the "regulation of cell development", "cell-cell junction", and "ATPase activity". Among the top 20 CpGs, nine global DQ scores related-CpGs had blood-brain DNA methylation correlations, and six CpGs among them had an absolute Spearman correlation coefficient bigger than 0.2. CONCLUSIONS: Preschoolers from a former impoverished county exhibited epigenome-wide DNAm changes strongly linked to early neurodevelopment. This study enhances our understanding of the epigenetic landscape associated with early neurodevelopment, and suggests the potential for developmenting epigenetic biomarkers that could facilitate the early identification of children at a higher risk of compromised neurodevelopment, as well as holding implication to inform novel interventions, especially in underprivileged regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of acid mucopolysaccharide by the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) of the predominant disaccharide units of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (chondroitin sulfate, CS; dermatan sulfate, DS; heparan sulfate, HS) after methanolysis is validated and applicable for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type determination. METHODS: A total of 76 urine samples were collected and analyzed, from nine MPS I patients, 13 MPS II patients, seven MPS III patients, eight MPS VI patients, and 39 normal controls. Urinary GAG was first precipitated by the Alcian blue method followed by a treatment of 3 N HCl methanol. The protonated species of the methylated disaccharide products were detected by using a multiple reaction monitoring experiment. Internal standards, [2H6] CS, [2H6] DS and [2H6] HS, were prepared in-house by deuteriomethanolysis of CS, DS and HS. RESULTS: One particular disaccharide for each GAG was selected, in which the parent ion and its daughter ion after collision were m/z 426.1 -> 236.2 for DS (m/z 432 -> 239 for dimers derived from [2H6] CS and [2H6] DS) and m/z 384.2 -> 161.9 for HS (m/z 390.4 -> 162.5 for the [2H6] HS dimer). The quantities of DS and HS were determined, which varied from one MPS type to the other. The results can be used to evaluate the severity of MPS subgroups, as well as urinary GAG amelioration at follow-up after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). CONCLUSIONS: The modified LC-MS/MS method for MPS type determination is specific, sensitive, validated, accurate, and applicable for simultaneous quantifications of urinary DS and HS. This method can help to make correct diagnosis of MPS patients and evaluate the effectiveness of ERT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent work suggests that DNA methylation can be used as a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure (MPS-GC), showing associations with maternal psychopathology during pregnancy. However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. METHODS: Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at birth. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT28, OMIM #617284) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by early onset movement disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. In this study, we describe the use of a genome methylation episignature methodology to functionally validate two variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the KMT2B gene. METHODS: Genome-wide methylation status was assessed using the EPIC methylation assay in peripheral blood samples from two subjects with early onset movement disorder and missense variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2B gene (p.Leu1720Phe and p.Tyr2515Cys). After QC and normalization steps, we compared the M values for all 144 probes, previously described as an EpiSign for KMT2B-related dystonia, between the two subjects and 14 controls individuals. RESULTS: The individual harboring the p.Tyr2515Cys variant exhibited a hypermethylation profile compatible with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in KMT2B, allowing for variant reclassification, conclusive genetic counseling, and patient stratification for deep brain stimulation. In contrast, the individual harboring the p.Leu1720Phe variant had a methylation status similar to controls, practically ruling out KMT2B-related dystonia. CONCLUSION: Investigation of methylation status can be a powerful tool to determine pathogenicity when facing KMT2B variants of uncertain significance. Methylation results may optimize genetic counseling and positively impact patient care. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Diffuse IDH mutant low-grade gliomas (IDHmt LGG) (World Health Organization grade 2) typically affect young adults. The outcome is variable, with survival ranging from 5 to over 20 years. The timing and choice of initial treatments after surgery remain controversial. In particular, radiotherapy is associated with early and late cognitive toxicity. Over 90% of IDHmt LGG exhibit some degree of promoter methylation of the repair gene O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methytransferase (MGMTp) that when expressed blunts the effect of alkylating agent chemotherapy, for example, temozolomide (TMZ). However, the clinical value of MGMTp methylation predicting benefit from TMZ in IDHmt LGG is unclear. Methods: Patients treated in the EORTC-22033 phase III trial comparing TMZ versus radiotherapy served as training set to establish a cutoff based on the MGMT-STP27 methylation score. A validation cohort was established with patients treated in a single-center first-line with TMZ after surgery/surgeries. Results: The MGMT-STP27 methylation score was associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) in the training cohort treated with TMZ, but not radiotherapy. In the validation cohort, an association with next treatment-free survival (P = .045) after TMZ was observed, and a trend using RANO criteria (P = .07). A cutoff value set above the 95% confidence interval of being methylated was significantly associated with PFS in the TMZ-treated training cohort, but not in the radiotherapy arm. However, this cutoff could not be confirmed in the test cohort. Conclusions: While the MGMTp methylation score was associated with better outcomes in TMZ-treated IDHmt LGG, a cutoff could not be established to guide treatment decisions.

AB  - DNA-methylation profile scores (MPSs) index biology relevant for lifelong physical and cognitive health, but information on their longitudinal stability in childhood is lacking. Using two waves of data collected from 2014 to 2022 (Mlag between waves = 2.41 years) from N = 407 participants (Mage = 12.05 years, 51% female, 60% White), test-retest correlations were estimated for four salivary MPSs related to aging (PhenoAgeAccel, GrimAgeAccel, DunedinPACE), and cognitive function (Epigenetic-g). MPSs varied in longitudinal stability (test-retest rs = 0.38 to 0.76). MPSs did not differ in children exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, but race-ethnic and sex differences were apparent. Further research is necessary to understand which environmental perturbations impact DNA-methylation trajectories and when children are most sensitive to those impacts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is a biological necessity and fundamental to health. However, the associations of sleep patterns (integrating sleep determinants) with DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAm AA) remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the associations of sleep patterns with DNAm AA. METHODS: This cross-sectional and prospective cohort study used data from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort collected from 2013 to December 31, 2018. Sleep patterns were reflected by sleep scores (range 0-4, with higher scores indicating healthier sleep patterns) characterized by bedtime, sleep duration, sleep quality, and midday napping. DNAm AA was estimated by PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), GrimAge acceleration (GrimAgeAccel), DunedinPACE, and DNAm mortality risk score (DNAm MS). Linear regression models were used to estimate beta and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations between sleep patterns and DNAm AA. Mediation models were applied to assess the mediating role of DNAm AA in the associations between sleep patterns and all-cause mortality in a prospective cohort. RESULTS: Among 3566 participants (mean age 65.5 years), 426 participants died during a mean 5.4-year follow-up. A higher sleep score was associated with lower DNAm AA in a dose-response manner. Each 1-point increase in sleep score was associated with significantly lower PhenoAgeAccel (beta = - 0.208; 95% CI - 0.369 to - 0.047), GrimAgeAccel (beta = - 0.107; 95% CI - 0.207 to - 0.007), DunedinPACE (beta = - 0.008; 95% CI - 0.012 to - 0.004), and DNAm MS (beta = - 0.019; 95% CI - 0.030 to - 0.008). Chronological age modified the associations between higher sleep scores and lower PhenoAgeAccel (p for interaction = 0.031) and DunedinPACE (p for interaction = 0.027), with stronger associations observed in older adults. Moreover, a slower DunedinPACE mediated 6.2% (95% CI 0.8% to 11.5%) of the association between a higher sleep score and a lower all-cause mortality risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, individuals with a higher sleep score had a slower DNAm AA, particularly in older adults. A slower DunedinPACE partially explained the association between higher sleep scores and lower all-cause mortality risk. These findings suggest that adopting healthy sleep patterns may promote healthy aging and further benefit premature mortality prevention, highlighting the value of sleep patterns as a potential tool for clinical management in aging.

AB  - Background Inflammation is implicated in depression and psychosis, including association of childhood inflammatory markers on the subsequent risk of developing symptoms. However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Methods Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N=up-to 6,401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Results Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10-28y (n=4,262; β=0.086; 95%CI:0.036-0.137; pFDR=0.009). CRP DNAm score at birth was associated with total number of PEs, size but this association did not survive correction for multiple testing (n=822; β=0.204; 95%CI:0.024-0.388; puncorrected=0.027; pFDR=0.252). Other immune measures were not associated with depression or PEs. Conclusions Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

AB  - Autosomal dominant CDK13-related disease is characterized by congenital heart defects, dysmorphic facial features, and intellectual developmental disorder (CHDFIDD). Heterozygous pathogenic variants, particularly missense variants in the kinase domain, have previously been described as disease causing. Using the determination of a methylation pattern and comparison with an established episignature, we reveal the first hypomorphic variant in the kinase domain of CDK13, leading to a never before described autosomal recessive form of CHDFIDD in a boy with characteristic features. This highlights the utility of episignatures in variant interpretation, as well as a potential novel diagnostic approach in unsolved cases or for disease prognosis. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Germline mutations have been identified in a small number of hereditary cancers, but the genetic predisposition for many familial cancers remains to be elucidated. Methods: This study identified a Chinese pedigree that presented different cancers (breast cancer, BRCA; adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, AEG; and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL) in each of the three generations. Whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow and cancer biopsy samples. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted on the monozygotic twin brothers, one of whom developed B-ALL. Results: According to the ACMG guidelines, bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequencing revealed 20 germline mutations, particularly mutations in the DNAH11 (c.9463G > A) and CFH (c.2314G > A) genes that were documented in the COSMIC database and validated by Sanger sequencing. Forty-one common somatic mutated genes were identified in the cancer samples, displaying the same type of single nucleotide substitution Signature 5. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA as well as hypermethylation of CpG island associated with WT1 was shown in the twin with B-ALL. Conclusions: These findings reveal genomic alterations in a pedigree with multiple cancers. Mutations found in the DNAH11, CFH genes, and other genes predispose to malignancies in this family. Dysregulated methylation of WT1, PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA in the twin with B-ALL increases cancer susceptibility. The similarity of the somatic genetic changes among the three cancers indicates a hereditary impact on the pedigree. These familial cancers with germline and somatic mutations, as well as epigenomic alterations, represent a common molecular basis for many multiple cancer pedigrees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of developmental disorders (DD) is characterized by disease-specific genome-wide methylation changes. These episignatures inform on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, the detection of these episignature requires the use of indirect methylation profiling methodologies. We hypothesized that long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants but also episignatures. METHODS: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing was performed in 40 controls and 20 patients with confirmed or suspected episignature-associated DD, representing 13 distinct diseases. Following genomic variant and methylome calling, hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures. Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) for the detection of each DD. RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing-based methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based episignatures. Our SVM-based classifier identified the episignatures in 17/19 patients with a (likely) pathogenic variant and none of the controls. The remaining patients in which no episignature was identified were also classified as controls by a commercial microarray assay. In addition, we identified all underlying pathogenic single nucleotide and structural variants and showed haplotype-aware skewed X-inactivation evaluation directs clinical interpretation. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates nanopore sequencing enables episignature detection. In addition, concurrent haplotyped genomic and epigenomic analyses leverage simultaneous detection of single nucleotide/structural variants, X-inactivation, and imprinting, consolidating a multi-step sequential process into a single diagnostic assay.

AB  - Identifying and refining clinically significant patient stratification is a critical step toward realizing the promise of precision medicine in asthma. Several peripheral blood hallmarks, including total peripheral blood eosinophil count (BEC) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, are routinely used in asthma clinical practice for endotype classification and predicting response to state-of-the-art targeted biologic drugs. However, these biomarkers appear ineffective in predicting treatment outcomes in some patients, and they differ in distribution between racially and ethnically diverse populations, potentially compromising medical care and hindering health equity due to biases in drug eligibility. Here, we propose constructing an unbiased patient stratification score based on DNA methylation (DNAm) and utilizing it to refine the efficacy of hallmark biomarkers for predicting drug response. We developed Phenotype Aware Component Analysis (PACA), a novel contrastive machine-learning method for learning combinations of DNAm sites reflecting biomedically meaningful patient stratifications. Leveraging whole-blood DNAm from Latino (discovery; n=1,016) and African American (replication; n=756) pediatric asthma case-control cohorts, we applied PACA to refine the prediction of bronchodilator response (BDR) to the short-acting beta2-agonist albuterol, the most used drug to treat acute bronchospasm worldwide. While BEC and IgE correlate with BDR in the general patient population, our PACA-derived DNAm score renders these biomarkers predictive of drug response only in patients with high DNAm scores. BEC correlates with BDR in patients with upper-quartile DNAm scores (OR 1.12; 95% CI [1.04, 1.22]; P=7.9 e-4) but not in patients with lower-quartile scores (OR 1.05; 95% CI [0.95, 1.17]; P=0.21); and IgE correlates with BDR in above-median (OR for response 1.42; 95% CI [1.24, 1.63]; P=3.9e-7) but not in below-median patients (OR 1.05; 95% CI [0.92, 1.2]; P=0.57). These results hold within the commonly recognized type 2 (T2)-high asthma endotype but not in T2-low patients, suggesting that our DNAm score primarily represents an unknown variation of T2 asthma. Among T2-high patients with high DNAm scores, elevated BEC or IgE also corresponds to baseline clinical presentation that is known to benefit more from biologic treatment, including higher exacerbation scores, higher allergen sensitization, lower BMI, more recent oral corticosteroids prescription, and lower lung function. Our findings suggest that BEC and IgE, the traditional asthma biomarkers of T2-high asthma, are poor biomarkers for millions worldwide. Revisiting existing drug eligibility criteria relying on these biomarkers in asthma medical care may enhance precision and equity in treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older chronological age is associated with decreased multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse rates and increased risk of progressive disease. Measurement of biological age may be more precise than birthdate in understanding these aging effects. In addition to normal aging, MS-related accelerated aging may contribute. Measurement of biological age in adults may be confounded by the effects of natural aging and age-related comorbidities. Examining age extremes can be informative, and demonstrating accelerated biological aging in children would support a hypothesis of MS driving premature aging. We sought to compare epigenetic age in participants with pediatric-onset MS (POMS) and age-similar controls. METHODS: We performed a multicenter case-control analysis of epigenetic age in a prospectively collected set of whole blood DNA samples and clinical data. Quantitative methylation scores were derived for approximately 850,000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. Epigenetic age was calculated based on 4 established epigenetic clock algorithms. Epigenetic age and age acceleration residual (AAR) were compared between participants with POMS and age-similar controls using multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for demographic variables. RESULTS: Epigenetic age and AAR were greater in cases (n = 125, mean age 15.7 years [SD = 2.6], 63.2% female) compared with controls (n = 145, mean age 15.3 years [SD = 3.4], 63.5% female) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, tobacco exposure, and socioeconomic status. This difference was statistically significant for 2 of the 4 epigenetic clocks used (Horvath beta = 0.31 years [CI = -0.32-0.94], p = 0.33; Hannum beta = 1.50 years [CI = 0.58-2.42], p = 0.002; GrimAge beta = 0.33 years [CI = -0.30-0.96], p = 0.29; PhenoAge beta = 1.72 years [CI = 0.09-3.35], p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: We observed greater point estimates of epigenetic age in participants with POMS compared with healthy controls in all epigenetic clocks tested. This difference was statistically significant for the Hannum and PhenoAge clocks after multivariable modeling. These results are consistent with those of studies in adult MS and suggest that accelerated aging may be present even in the youngest people living with MS.

AB  - CREB-binding protein (CBP, encoded by CREBBP) and its paralog E1A-associated protein (p300, encoded by EP300) are involved in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation. Variants that produce a null allele or disrupt the catalytic domain of either protein cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), while pathogenic missense and in-frame indel variants in parts of exons 30 and 31 cause phenotypes recently described as Menke-Hennekam syndrome (MKHK). To distinguish MKHK subtypes and define their characteristics, molecular and extended clinical data on 82 individuals (54 unpublished) with variants affecting CBP (n = 71) or p300 (n = 11) (NP_004371.2 residues 1,705-1,875 and NP_001420.2 residues 1,668-1,833, respectively) were summarized. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were assessed in DNA extracted from whole peripheral blood from 54 individuals. Most variants clustered closely around the zinc-binding residues of two zinc-finger domains (ZZ and TAZ2) and within the first alpha helix of the fourth intrinsically disordered linker (ID4) of CBP/p300. Domain-specific methylation profiles were discerned for the ZZ domain in CBP/p300 (found in nine out of 10 tested individuals) and TAZ2 domain in CBP (in 14 out of 20), while a domain-specific diagnostic episignature was refined for the ID4 domain in CBP/p300 (in 21 out of 21). Phenotypes including intellectual disability of varying degree and distinct physical features were defined for each of the regions. These findings demonstrate existence of at least three MKHK subtypes, which are domain specific (MKHK-ZZ, MKHK-TAZ2, and MKHK-ID4) rather than gene specific (CREBBP/EP300). DNA methylation episignatures enable stratification of molecular pathophysiologic entities within a gene or across a family of paralogous genes. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The term “recurrent constellations of embryonic malformations” (RCEM) is used to describe a number of multiple malformation associations that affect three or more body structures. The causes of these disorders are currently unknown, and no diagnostic marker has been identified. Consequently, providing a definitive diagnosis in suspected individuals is challenging. In this study, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted on DNA samples obtained from the peripheral blood of 53 individuals with RCEM characterized by clinical features recognized as VACTERL and/or oculoauriculovertebral spectrum association. We identified a common DNA methylation episignature in 40 out of the 53 individuals. Subsequently, a sensitive and specific binary classifier was developed based on the DNA methylation episignature. This classifier can facilitate the use of RCEM episignature as a diagnostic biomarker in a clinical setting. The study also investigated the functional correlation of RCEM DNA methylation relative to other genetic disorders with known episignatures, highlighting the common genomic regulatory pathways involved in the pathophysiology of RCEM.

AB  - Purpose: Valproic acid or valproate is an effective antiepileptic drug; however, embryonic exposure to valproate can result in a teratogenic disorder referred to as fetal valproate syndrome (OMIM #609442). Currently there are no diagnostic biomarkers for the condition. This study aims to define fi ne an episignature biomarker for teratogenic antenatal exposure to valproate. Methods: DNA extracted from peripheral blood of individuals with teratogenic antenatal exposure to valproate was processed using DNA methylation microarrays. Subsequently, methylation profiling fi ling and construction of support vector machine classifiers fi ers were performed in R. Results: Genomic DNA methylation analysis was applied, and a distinct DNA methylation profile fi le was identified fi ed in the majority of affected individuals. This profile fi le was used to develop a diagnostic episignature classifier. fi er. The valproate exposure episignature exhibited high sensitivity and specificity fi city relative to a large reference data set of unaffected controls and individuals with a wide spectrum of syndromic disorders with episignatures. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated an enrichment for terms associated with cell adhesion, including significant fi cant overrepresentation of the cadherin superfamily. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of a robust peripheral blood-based diagnostic epigenetic biomarker for a prenatal teratogenic disorder.

AB  - Adaptive nanopore sequencing as a diagnostic method for imprinting disorders and episignature analysis revealed an intragenic duplication of Exon 6 and 7 in UBE3A (NM_000462.5) in a patient with relatively mild Angelman-like syndrome. In an all-in-one nanopore sequencing analysis DNA hypomethylation of the SNURF:TSS-DMR, known contributing deletions on the maternal allele and point mutations in UBE3A could be ruled out as disease drivers. In contrast, breakpoints and orientation of the tandem duplication could clearly be defined. Segregation analysis in the family showed that the duplication derived de novo in the maternal grandfather. Our study shows the benefits of an all-in-one nanopore sequencing approach for the diagnostics of Angelman syndrome and other imprinting disorders.

AB  - Rare genetic variants in ARID2 are responsible for a recently described neurodevelopmental condition called ARID2-related disorder (ARID2-RD). ARID2 belongs to PBAF, a unit of the SWI/SNF complex, which is a chromatin remodeling complex. This work aims to further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of ARID2-RD, providing clinicians with additional data for better care and aid in the future diagnosis of this condition. We obtained the genotypes and phenotypes of 27 previously unreported individuals with ARID2-RD and compared this series with findings in the literature. We also assessed peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles in individuals with ARID2-RD compared to episignatures of controls, unresolved cases, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The main clinical features of ARID2-RD are developmental delay, speech disorders, intellectual disability (ID), behavior problems, short stature, and various dysmorphic and ectodermal features. Genome-wide differential methylation analysis revealed a global hypermethylated profile in ARID2-RD that could aid in reclassifying variants of uncertain significance. Our study doubles the number of reported individuals with ARID2 pathogenic variants to 53. It confirms loss-of-function as a pathomechanism and shows the absence of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. We provide evidence for a unique DNA methylation episignature for ARID2-RD and further delineate the ARID2-associated phenotype.

AB  - Pathogenic heterozygous variants in CHD4 cause Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with brain anomalies, heart defects, macrocephaly, hypogonadism, and additional features with variable expressivity. Most individuals have non-recurrent missense variants, complicating variant interpretation. A few were reported with truncating variants, and their role in disease is unclear. DNA methylation episignatures have emerged as highly accurate diagnostic biomarkers in a growing number of rare diseases. We aimed to study evidence for the existence of a CHD4-related DNA methylation episignature. We collected blood DNA samples and/or clinical information from 39 individuals with CHD4 variants, including missense and truncating variants. Genomic DNA methylation analysis was performed on 28 samples. We identified a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature in samples with pathogenic missense variants within the ATPase/helicase domain. The same episignature was observed in a family with variable expressivity, a de novo variant near the PHD domain, variants of uncertain significance within the ATPase/helicase domain, and a sample with compound heterozygous variants. DNA methylation data revealed higher percentages of shared probes with BAFopathies, CHD8, and the terminal ADNP variants encoding a protein known to form the ChAHP complex with CHD4. Truncating variants, as well as a sample with a recurrent pathogenic missense variant, exhibited DNA methylation profiles distinct from the ATPase/helicase domain episignature. These DNA methylation differences, together with the distinct clinical features observed in those individuals, provide preliminary evidence for clinical and molecular sub-types in the CHD4-related disorder.

AB  - Developmental Delay with Gastrointestinal, Cardiovascular, Genitourinary, and Skeletal Abnormalities syndrome (DEGCAGS, MIM #619488) is caused by biallelic, loss-of-function (LoF) ZNF699 variants, and is characterized by variable neurodevelopmental disability, discordant organ anomalies among full siblings and infant mortality. ZNF699 encodes a KRAB zinc finger protein of unknown function. We aimed to investigate the genotype-phenotype spectrum of DEGCAGS and the possibility of a diagnostic DNA methylation episignature, to facilitate the diagnosis of a highly variable condition lacking pathognomonic clinical findings. We collected data on 30 affected individuals (12 new). GestaltMatcher analyzed fifty-three facial photographs from five individuals. In nine individuals, methylation profiling of blood-DNA was performed, and a classification model was constructed to differentiate DEGCAGS from controls. We expand the ZNF699-related molecular spectrum and show that biallelic, LoF, ZNF699 variants cause unique clinical findings with age-related presentation and a similar facial gestalt. We also identified a robust episignature for DEGCAGS syndrome. DEGCAGS syndrome is a clinically variable recessive syndrome even among siblings with a distinct methylation episignature which can be used as a screening, diagnostic and classification tool for ZNF699 variants. Analysis of differentially methylated regions suggested an effect on genes potentially implicated in the syndrome's pathogenesis. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has become a global pandemic and is one of the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular disease later in life. The correlation of epigenetic marks with obesity and related traits is being elucidated. This review summarizes the latest research and its challenges in the study of epigenetics of (childhood) obesity. SUMMARY: Epigenome-wide association studies helped identify novel targets and methylation sites that are important in the pathophysiology of obesity. In the future, such sites will become essential for developing methylation risk scores (MRS) for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Although MRS are very promising for predicting the individual risk of obesity, the implementation of MRS is challenging and has not been introduced into clinical practice so far. KEY MESSAGES: Future research will undoubtedly discover numerous methylation sites that may be involved in the development of obesity and its comorbidities, especially at a young age. This will contribute to a better understanding of the complex etiology of human obesity. From a clinical perspective, the overarching aim was to generate MRS that is robust for reliable and accurate prediction of obesity and its comorbidities. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a clinical diagnosis requiring the fulfillment of ≥ 4/6 Netchine-Harbison Clinical Scoring System (NH-CSS) criteria. A score of ≥ 4/6 NH-CSS (or ≥ 3/6 with strong clinical suspicion) warrants (epi)genetic confirmation, identifiable in ∼60% patients. The approach to the investigation and diagnosis of SRS is detailed in the only international consensus guidance, published in 2016. In the intervening years, the clinical, biochemical, and (epi)genetic characteristics of SRS have rapidly expanded, largely attributable to advancing molecular genetic techniques and a greater awareness of related disorders. The most common etiologies of SRS remain loss of methylation of chromosome 11p15 (11p15LOM) and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat). Rarer causes of SRS include monogenic pathogenic variants in imprinted (CDKN1C and IGF2) and non-imprinted (PLAG1 and HMGA2) genes. Although the age-specific NH-CSS can identify more common molecular causes of SRS, its use in identifying monogenic causes is unclear. Preliminary data suggest that NH-CSS is poor at identifying many of these cases. Additionally, there has been increased recognition of conditions with phenotypes overlapping with SRS that may fulfill NH-CSS criteria but have distinct genetic etiologies and disease trajectories. This group of conditions is frequently overlooked and under-investigated, leading to no or delayed diagnosis. Like SRS, these conditions are multisystemic disorders requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored management strategies. Early identification is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce the major burden of the diagnostic odyssey for patients and families. This article aims to enable clinicians to identify key features of rarer causes of SRS and conditions with overlapping phenotypes, show a logical approach to the molecular investigation, and highlight the differences in clinical management strategies.

AB  - DNA methylation signatures ("episignatures") can be used as biomarkers of genetic aberrations, clinical phenotypes, and environmental exposures in rare diseases. Episignatures are utilized in molecular diagnostics and can clarify variants of uncertain significance. A growing number of disease genes, including epilepsy genes, exhibit robust and reproducible episignatures. However, whether SCN1A, the most prominent epilepsy gene, has one or more episignatures has not yet been determined. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation data and performed episignature analysis on 64 individuals with Dravet syndrome due to pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SCN1A and seven individuals with early infantile SCN1A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) variants in SCN1A, relative to a large reference database of controls and rare disease episignature-positive cohorts. We analyzed all samples with LOF variants together and performed separate analyses for missense, nonsense, and GOF variant cohorts. A reproducible blood-derived episignature was not evident in any of the cohorts using current analytical approaches and reference data. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Sequence-based genetic testing identifies causative variants in ~ 50% of individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. We interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 582 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs. We identify rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to uncover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 12 individuals. Using long-read sequencing, we identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and four copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic variants associated with episignatures. Finally, we refine the CHD2 episignature using an 850 K methylation array and bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate variants as 2% (12/582) for unsolved DEE cases. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Histories of early life stress (ELS) or social discrimination can reach levels of severity characterized as toxic to mental and physical health. Such toxic social stress during development has been linked to altered acute hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to social stress in adulthood. However, there are important individual differences in the size and direction of these effects. We explored developmental, genetic, epigenetic, and contextual sources of individual differences in the relationship between ELS, discrimination, and adult responses to acute social stress in a standard laboratory test. Additional measures included perceived status, social support, background activity of HPA axis, and genetic variants in aspects of the stress response system. Participants (n = 90) answered questions about historical and ongoing stress, provided a DNA sample to examine genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic marks, and underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) during which three saliva samples were collected to assess HPA function. Individuals who reported high levels of childhood adversity had a blunted salivary cortisol response to the TSST. Childhood adversity, discrimination experiences, and MPS genotype were found to predict pretest cortisol levels. Following up on recent observations that the glucocorticoid receptor directly interacts with the mitochondria] genome, particularly the NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) gene, individuals who reported high childhood adversity were also found to have higher percent methylation across six CpG sites upstream of MT-ND6. These findings suggest multiple contributions across psychological, genetic, epigenetic, and social domains to vulnerability and resilience in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. Further study to examine how these multiple contributors affect developmental endpoints through integrated or independent pathways will be of use.

AB  - Background: Past experiences of maltreatment and life adversity induce DNA methylation changes in adults, but less is known about their impact on mothers’ maladaptive neglectful parenting and its negative effects. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate the role of DNA methylation levels in mothers with neglectful care, who were exposed to childhood maltreatment and neglect, and their current negative effects. Saliva DNA methylation was determined with the Illumina Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip v1. The individual epigenome was the input to a machine learning algorithm for trajectory inference, which assigned a specific state to each mother in the progression from healthy controls to the extreme neglect condition. A compound epigenetic maternal neglect score (EMN) was derived from 138 mothers (n = 51 in the neglectful group; n = 87 in the control non-neglectful group) having young children. Differential methylation between groups was utilized to derive the EMNs adjusted for education level, age, experimental variables, and blood cell types in saliva samples. Results: Structural equation modeling: X2 (29) = 37.81; p = 0.127; RMSEA = 0.048, confirmed that EMNs link their early experience of physical neglect to current reports of psychopathological symptoms, lower cognitive status, and observed poor mother–child emotional availability. A third of the genes annotated to the CpGs that affect EMNs are related to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative and psychopathological disorders. Conclusions: EMNs are a novel index to assess the contribution of DNA methylations as a neglected girl to later neglectful caregiving behavior and other negative effects. The evidence provided expands the possibilities for earlier interventions on the neglect condition to prevent and ameliorate the direct or indirect epigenetic impact of maternal adversities on mother–child care, helping to break the cycle of maltreatment.

AB  - Gene mutations occur with high frequency in children with mental retardation. Standard diagnostic methods, such as TMS, Sanger's sequencing of individual genes, MLPA analysis of deletions, and investigation of methylation status in Martin-Bell syndrome are not informative in the majority of cases that hampered further diagnostic efforts. Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) allowed physicians to continue diagnostic search in previously undiagnosed cases and to find molecular causes of disease. MPS permits to discover a large number of new genes and understand the pathogenesis of mental retardation and brain development more deeply. It became possible to perform prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostics. However, big data generate big problems with their interpretation the genetic counselor faces with. This review reflects the advantages and disadvantages of MPS. Different variants of MPS, including gene panels, whole exome and whole genome sequencing as well as sequencing of trios, are described. In addition, the authors discuss the difficulties of interpretation of the results and recommendations for obtaining the most accurate results.

AB  - Poly-epigenetic scores (PEGS) are surrogate measures that help capture individual-level risk. Understanding how the associations between PEGS and cardiometabolic risk factors vary by demographics and health behaviors is crucial for lowering the burden of cardiometabolic diseases. We used results from established epigenome-wide association studies to construct trait-specific PEGS from whole blood DNA methylation for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and fasting glucose. Overall and race-stratified associations between PEGS and corresponding traits were examined in adults >50 years from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 3,996, mean age = 79.5 years). We investigated how demographics (age, sex, educational attainment) and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity) modified these associations. All PEGS were positively associated with their corresponding cardiometabolic traits (p < 0.05), and most associations persisted across all racial/ethnic groups. Associations for BMI, HDL-C, and TG were stronger in younger participants, and BMI and HDL-C associations were stronger in females. The CRP association was stronger among those with a high school degree. Finally, the HDL-C association was stronger among current smokers. These findings support PEGS as robust surrogate measures and suggest the associations may differ among subgroups.

AB  - SETD2 has an essential role in epigenetic regulation. SETD2 pathogenic variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders (SETD2-NDDs) that most commonly include various degrees of intellectual disability and behavioral disorders, macrocephaly, brain malformations, and generalized overgrowth. A distinctive DNA methylation episignature has been identified for Luscan-Lumish syndrome. A less common phenotype, denoted SETD2-NDD with multiple congenital anomalies, failure to thrive, and profound intellectual disability, has been reported in association with a particular pathogenic variant (p.Arg1740Trp). To date, about 50 patients have been described in the literature with SETD2 causative variants. We report here an individual with a phenotype distinct from SETD2-NDDs, including normal cognition, distinctive facial features, and multiple tumor histories, including a sacral osteoblastoma at age 7, a benign femoral bone tumor at age 17, a peritoneal pseudomyxoma at age 27, and a hypophyseal macroadenoma and a low-grade optochiasmatic glioma at age 37 years. Trio exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous missense variant of unknown significance (p.Ser1658Leu) in the SETD2 gene. DNA methylation study by EpiSign assay confirmed the presence of an episignature profile compatible with SETD2-related disorders. Given the implication of somatic SETD2 variants in benign and malignant tumors, the implication of these SETD2 constitutional variants in tumorigenesis is discussed. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) occurs predominantly in children and is typically characterized by diffuse leptomeningeal lesions throughout the neuroaxis with focal segments of parenchymal involvement. Recent reports have identified cases without diffuse leptomeningeal involvement that retain classic glioneuronal features on histology. In this report, we present a case of a 4-year-old boy with a large cystic-solid intramedullary spinal cord lesion that on surgical biopsy revealed a biphasic astrocytic tumor with sparsely distributed eosinophilic granular bodies and Rosenthal fibers. Next-generation sequencing revealed a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, 1p/19q codeletion, and lack of an IDH1 mutation. Methylation profiling demonstrated a calibrated class score of 0.98 for DLGNT and copy number loss of 1p. Despite the morphologic similarities to pilocytic astrocytoma and the lack of oligodendroglial/neuronal components or leptomeningeal dissemination, the molecular profile was definitive in classifying the tumor as DLGNT. This case highlights the importance of molecular and genetic testing in the characterization of pediatric central nervous system tumors.

AB  - Background: Few studies have examined associations between maternal epigenetic age acceleration and adverse birth outcomes, and none have investigated paternal epigenetic age acceleration. Our objective was to assess the associations of parental (both maternal and paternal) epigenetic age acceleration in relation to birth outcomes. Methods: Parental epigenetic age was estimated using seven established epigenetic clocks in 2198 mothers and 2193 fathers from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Individual epigenetic age acceleration was then calculated as residuals from linear regressions of estimates from the epigenetic clocks on chronological age. Further, linear regression was used to analyze differences in continuous outcomes (gestational length and standardized birthweight), while logistic regression was used for binary outcomes (preterm birth, post-term birth, small-for-gestational age [SGA], large-for-gestational age [LGA], and pre-eclampsia), adjusting for chronological age, parity, educational level, smoking, and BMI. Results: Increasing maternal, but not paternal, epigenetic age acceleration was associated with decreased gestational length for five out of six clocks, with adjusted estimates ranging from a mean 0.51-day decrease (95% CI − 1.00, − 0.02; p-value 0.043) for the Horvath clock to a 0.80-day decrease (95% CI − 1.29, − 0.31; p-value 0.002) for the Levine clock. An association with increasing maternal epigenetic age acceleration according to the DunedinPACE clock was also seen with greater standardized birthweight [mean difference 0.08 (95% CI 0.04, 0.12; p-value < 0.001]. These results were also reflected in an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth and LGA. No associations were observed with post-term birth, SGA, or pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Maternal, but not paternal, epigenetic age acceleration is associated with shorter pregnancies and an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. This may suggest that women’s biological age acceleration, including factors such as metabolic and physiologic state, is an additional risk factor for preterm delivery, beyond chronological age.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether prepregnancy BMI (prePregBMI) in women with obesity was associated with differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood (CB) and whether DNAm may mediate the association of prePregBMI and early childhood BMI z score (BMIz). METHODS: From the Treatment of Obese Pregnant Women (TOP) study, 232 mother-child pairs were included. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on prePregBMI and CB DNAm (450k array), followed by causal mediation analyses to test whether DNAm may mediate effects of prePregBMI on BMIz at age 36 months (BMIz36). RESULTS: DNAm at 5345 CpG sites annotated to 2842 genes, which were overrepresented in biological processes linked to carbohydrate metabolism and plasma lipoprotein particle clearance, was associated with prePregBMI (false discovery rate < 10%). Causal mediation analyses of 168 methylation sites associated with BMIz36 (p < 0.05) and overlapping with the 5345 prePregBMI-associated sites identified two sites on SYT7 and DEAF1, partially mediating the effect of prePregBMI on BMIz36 (p <= 0.01). After cross-validation, a methylation risk score including these two sites could predict the highest quartile of BMIz36 and fat mass (in grams) with area under the curve = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85) and area under the curve = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CB DNAm at birth may partially mediate effects of prePregBMI on early childhood BMIz36, supporting its plausible role in influencing individual future obesity risk.

AB  - Disorders of developmental delay can occur from pathogenic variants in genes responsible for epigenetic regulation. Heterozygous and biallelic pathogenic variants in TET3 have recently been described in TET3-related Beck–Fahrner syndrome (TET3-BEFAHRS), representing an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity. Typical features include intellectual disability and developmental delay. Patients can also present with facial dysmorphism, seizure disorder, ophthalmic findings, and other neurobehavioral features. As the condition has recently been described and few patients have been reported in literature, the full scope of the phenotypic spectrum and approaches to identify them are still emerging. We report an individual meeting the criteria for TET3-BEFAHRS confirmed through clinical, genetic, and DNA methylation episignature analysis, who uniquely presents with bilateral chorioretinal and unilateral right iris colobomata. This case suggests a broader ophthalmic phenotype to TET3-BEFAHRS and demonstrates the utility of episignatures for the diagnosis of Mendelian disorders of epigenetic machinery.

AB  - CONTEXT: Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HI) can be the presenting feature of Kabuki syndrome (KS), which is caused by loss-of-function variants in KMT2D or KDM6A. As these genes play a critical role in maintaining methylation status in chromatin, individuals with pathogenic variants have a disease-specific epigenomic profile-an episignature. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the pathogenicity of 3 novel partial KDM6A duplications identified in 3 individuals presenting with neonatal-onset HI without typical features of KS at the time of genetic testing. METHODS: Three different partial KDM6A duplications were identified by routine targeted next-generation sequencing for HI and initially classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as their location, and hence their impact on the gene, was not known. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was undertaken to map the breakpoints of the duplications with DNA methylation profiling performed in 2 individuals to investigate the presence of a KS-specific episignature. RESULTS: WGS confirmed the duplication in proband 1 as pathogenic as it caused a frameshift in the normal copy of the gene leading to a premature termination codon. The duplications identified in probands 2 and 3 did not alter the reading frame, and therefore their significance remained uncertain after WGS. Subsequent DNA methylation profiling identified a KS-specific episignature in proband 2 but not in proband 3. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm a role for KDM6A partial gene duplications in the etiology of KS and highlight the importance of performing in-depth molecular genetic analysis to properly assess the clinical significance of VUS' in the KDM6A gene.

AB  - Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a disorder of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in CREBBP and EP300. RTS is characterized by a distinct facial gestalt, intellectual disability, structural kidney and heart differences, feeding difficulties, and broad thumbs and great toes. Individuals with EP300 variants tend to have milder disease, but overall disease features are similar. Recently, a cohort of individuals with heterozygous variants in exons 30-31 of CREBBP and homologous regions in EP300 was described. Affected individuals presented with global developmental delay, autism, feeding difficulties, vision and hearing impairment, and microcephaly, but did not share the typical RTS facial gestalt or organ malformations, suggesting an allelic disorder. Here we present a family with mild dysmorphisms, recurrent respiratory infections, and speech delay found by exome sequencing to have a missense variant in exon 8 of EP300 in the KIX CBP coactivator domain. Follow-up methylation testing revealed an abnormal methylation pattern overlapping with both RTS and Cornelia de Lange syndromes. We propose that missense variants in EP300 may cause a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome with a milder phenotype. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - PURPOSEWe describe findings from genomic profiling of tumors among infantile pediatric patients studied within a translational research protocol established at our pediatric tertiary care center. Comprehensive genomic profiling was initiated to aid in diagnosis, prognostication, treatment, and detection of germline disease predisposition in this patient cohort.METHODSEnhanced exome sequencing of disease and comparator tissue was coupled with RNA sequencing of the disease-involved specimen to assess for single nucleotide variation, insertion/deletions, copy number alteration, structural variation, fusions, and methylation profiling-based tumor classification scores.RESULTSAmong 317 patients who consented to the protocol, 39 (12%) had infantile cancers diagnosed at <= 1 year of age. Germline genetic alteration was frequent with 11 of 39 patients (28%) harboring a pathogenic change. Clinically relevant findings affecting diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or surveillance were identified in 37 of 39 (95%) patients.CONCLUSIONOur data support that a pediatric cohort gains significant benefit from a comprehensive profiling approach, with a high yield of clinically significant findings. Nearly half of the infants in this cancer cohort harbored tumors potentially susceptible to therapeutic targets on the basis of genomic profile, and among these, another half sought benefit from therapeutic implementation.

AB  - Background: Early adversity increases the risk for mental and physical disorders as well as premature death. Epigenetic processes, and altered epigenetic aging in particular, might mediate these effects. While the literature that examined links between early adversity and epigenetic aging is growing, results have been heterogeneous. Objective: In the current work, we explored the link between early adversity and epigenetic aging in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults. Method: A total of N = 117 young adults (32% women, age mean = 26.3 years, SD = 3.6 years) with previous youth residential care placements completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Life Events Checklist (LEC-R) and provided blood samples for the analysis of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Microarray. Epigenetic age was estimated using Hovarth's and Hannum's epigenetic clocks. Furthermore, Hovarth's and Hannum's epigenetic age residuals were calculated as a proxy of epigenetic aging by regressing epigenetic age on chronological age. The statistical analysis plan was preregistered (https://osf.io/b9ev8). Results: Childhood trauma (CTQ) was negatively associated with Hannum's epigenetic age residuals, beta = -.23, p = .004 when controlling for sex, BMI, smoking status and proportional white blood cell type estimates. This association was driven by experiences of physical neglect, beta = -.25, p = .001. Lifetime trauma exposure (LEC-R) was not a significant predictor of epigenetic age residuals. Conclusion: Childhood trauma, and physical neglect in particular, was associated with decelerated epigenetic aging in our sample. More studies focusing on formerly institutionalized at-risk populations are needed to better understand which factors affect stress-related adaptations following traumatic experiences.

AB  - Importance: Children with developmental delays are at a heightened risk of experiencing mental health challenges, and this risk is exacerbated among racially minoritized children who face disproportionate adversity. Understanding the impact of parenting interventions on biological markers associated with these risks is crucial for mitigating long-term health disparities. Objective: To examine the effect of 20 weeks of an internet-based parent-child interaction training (iPCIT) program on biomarkers associated with aging and chronic inflammation among preschoolers with developmental delay at 12-month follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: An observational secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 17, 2016, to December 15, 2020, to assess changes in salivary DNA methylation (DNAm)-derived biomarkers following iPCIT intervention. Participants were recruited from 3 Part C early intervention sites in a large southeastern US city. Eligible participants included children recruited within 3 months of their third birthday who had a Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Problems T score greater than 60 and provided saliva in at least 1 study wave. Data analysis was conducted May 2023 to April 2024. Intervention: Participants received either iPCIT (a telehealth therapeutic intervention focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship and addressing behavioral challenges in young children) or referrals as usual. Main Outcomes and Measures: DNAm at the 12-month follow-up was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC Bead Chip Assay to derive biomarkers DunedinPACE, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analyses were intent-to-treat and used path analysis. Results: A total of 71 children (mean [SD] age, 36.27 [0.61] months 51 male [71.8%] and 20 female [28.2%]) were analyzed, of whom 34 received iPCIT and 37 received referrals as usual. The iPCIT group had a slower pace of aging (beta = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.50; P = .03) and less DNAm-derived CRP (beta = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.49; P = .01) relative to the control condition at the 12-month follow-up. These associations remained significant after accounting for baseline DNAm score, child demographics, and symptom severity, and were independent of predicted buccal epithelial cell proportion for both DunedinPACE and CRP. There was no association with DNAm-derived IL-6 (beta = 0.14; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.36; P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a parenting intervention, iPCIT, the association of intervention with decreased molecular markers of inflammation and biological aging suggests their potential to modify aspects of the biological embedding of stress. Understanding the systemic biological impact of such interventions offers insights into addressing health disparities and promoting resilience among vulnerable populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), sets of differential methylation marks (referred to as DNA methylation signatures or episignatures) are syndrome-specific and useful in evaluating the pathogenicity of detected genetic variants. These signatures have generally been tested using methylation arrays, requiring additional experimental and evaluation costs. As an alternative, long-read sequencing can simultaneously and accurately evaluate genetic and epigenetic changes. In addition, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling with more complete sets of CpG using long-read sequencing (than methylation arrays) may provide alternative but more comprehensive DNA methylation signatures, which have yet to be adequately investigated. METHODS: Nine and seven cases of molecularly diagnosed Sotos syndrome and ATR-X syndrome, respectively, were sequenced using nanopore long-read sequencing, together with 22 controls. Genome-wide differential DNA methylation analysis was performed. Among these differential DNA methylation sites, a single-locus DNA methylation mark at part of the NSD1 CpG island (CpGi) was subsequently studied in an additional 22 cases with a NSD1 point mutation or a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion involving NSD1. To investigate the potential utility of a single-locus DNA methylation test at NSD1 CpGi for differential diagnosis, nine cases with NSD1-negative clinically overlapping overgrowth intellectual disability syndromes (OGIDs) were also tested. RESULTS: Long-read sequencing enabled the successful extraction of two sets of differential methylation marks unique to each of Sotos syndrome and ATR-X syndrome, referred to as long-read-based DNA methylation signatures (LR-DNAm signatures), as alternatives to reported DNA methylation signatures (obtained by methylation array). Additionally, we found that a part, but not all, of the NSD1 CpGi were hypomethylated compared with the level in controls in both cases harboring NSD1 point mutations and those with a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion. This difference in methylation is specific to Sotos syndrome and lacking in other OGIDs. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous evaluation of genetic and epigenetic alterations using long-read sequencing may improve the discovery of DNA methylation signatures, which may in turn increase the diagnostic yields. As an example of the outcomes of these analyses, we propose that a single-locus DNA methylation test at NSD1 CpGi may streamline the molecular diagnosis of Sotos syndrome, regardless of the type of NSD1 aberration.

AB  - The major spliceosome contains five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs; U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) essential for splicing. Variants in RNU4-2, encoding U4, cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called ReNU syndrome. We investigated de novo variants in 50 snRNA-encoding genes in a French cohort of 23,649 individuals with rare disorders and gathered additional cases through international collaborations. Altogether, we identified 145 previously unreported probands with (likely) pathogenic variants in RNU4-2 and 21 individuals with de novo and/or recurrent variants in RNU5B-1 and RNU5A-1, encoding U5. Pathogenic variants typically arose de novo on the maternal allele and cluster in regions critical for splicing. RNU4-2 variants mainly localize to two structures, the stem III and T-loop/quasi-pseudoknot, which position the U6 ACAGAGA box for 5' splice site recognition and associate with different phenotypic severity. RNU4-2 variants result in specific defects in alternative 5' splice site usage and methylation patterns (episignatures) that correlate with variant location and clinical severity. This study establishes RNU5B-1 as a neurodevelopmental disorder gene, suggests RNU5A-1 as a strong candidate and highlights the role of de novo variants in snRNAs. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To determine associations between methylation of NR3C1, HSD11B2, FKBP5 and ADCYAP1R1 and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: In 537 newborns, placental methylation was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Profiles of neurobehavior were derived via the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scales. Using exploratory factor analysis, the relationships between methylation factor scores and neurobehavioral profiles were examined. Results: Increased scores of the factor characterized by NR3C1 methylation were associated with membership in a reactive, poorly regulated profile (odds ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.00- 2.18), while increased scores of the factor characterized by HSD11B2 methylation reduced this risk. Conclusion: These results suggest that coordinated regulation of these genes influences neurobehavior and demonstrates the importance of examining these alterations in a harmonized fashion.

AB  - Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder linked to haploinsufficiency of CREBBP (RSTS1) and EP300 (RSTS2) genes. Characteristic features often include distinctive facial traits, broad thumbs and toes, short stature, and various degrees of intellectual disability. The clinical presentation of RSTS is notably variable, making it challenging to establish a clear genotype–phenotype correlation, except for specific variants which cause the allelic Menke–Hennekam syndrome. Trio exome analysis, data collection via networking and GeneMatcher platforms, transcript processing analysis, and DNA methylation profiling were performed. We identified two unrelated patients with de novo variants in EP300 (NM_001429.4: c.3671+5G>C; c.3671+5_3671+8delGTAA) predicted to cause in-frame exon 20 skipping, confirmed in one patient. In silico 3D protein modeling suggested that exon 20 deletion (comprising 27 amino acids) likely alters the structural conformation between the RING_CBP-p300 and HAT-KAT11 domains. Clinically, both patients displayed severe RSTS2-like clinical features, including autism spectrum disorder, speech delay, hearing loss, microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, alongside ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Additionally, one patient developed early-onset colorectal cancer. DNA methylation profiling in Subject #1 confirmed RSTS but did not align with the specific episignatures for RSTS1 or RSTS2. We propose that skipping of exon 20 in EP300 is associated with a distinct form of Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome featuring clinical characteristics not fully aligning with RSTS1 or RSTS2. Our findings increase the understanding of RSTS genetic and molecular basis and stress the need for further research to establish definitive genotype–phenotype correlations.

AB  - Background Children from families with low socioeconomic status (SES), as determined by income, experience several negative outcomes, such as higher rates of newborn mortality and behavioral issues. Moreover, associations between DNA methylation and low income or poverty status are evident beginning at birth, suggesting prenatal influences on offspring development. Recent evidence suggests neighborhood opportunities may protect against some of the health consequences of living in low income households. The goal of this study was to assess whether neighborhood opportunities moderate associations between household income (HI) and neonate developmental maturity as measured with DNA methylation. Methods Umbilical cord blood DNA methylation data was available in 198 mother-neonate pairs from the larger CANDLE cohort. Gestational age acceleration was calculated using an epigenetic clock designed for neonates. Prenatal HI and neighborhood opportunities measured with the Childhood Opportunity Index (COI) were regressed on gestational age acceleration controlling for sex, race, and cellular composition. Results Higher HI was associated with higher gestational age acceleration (B = .145, t = 4.969, p = 1.56x10-6, 95% CI [.087, .202]). Contrary to expectation, an interaction emerged showing higher neighborhood educational opportunity was associated with lower gestational age acceleration at birth for neonates with mothers living in moderate to high HI (B = -.048, t = -2.08, p = .03, 95% CI [-.092, -.002]). Female neonates showed higher gestational age acceleration at birth compared to males. However, within males, being born into neighborhoods with higher social and economic opportunity was associated with higher gestational age acceleration. Conclusion Prenatal HI and neighborhood qualities may affect gestational age acceleration at birth. Therefore, policy makers should consider neighborhood qualities as one opportunity to mitigate prenatal developmental effects of HI.

AB  - PURPOSE: The current study aims to investigate the significance of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylationrelated genes in the clinical prognosis of childhood relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALLL) patient. METHODS: Transcriptome data and corresponding clinical data on m6A methylation-related genes (including 20 genes) were obtained from the Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. RESULTS: The bone marrow (BM) samples of 134 newly diagnosed (naive) and 116 relapsed B-ALL from TARGET were enrolled in the current study. Three genes (FTO, HNRNPC, RBM15B) showed significant up-regulation in relapsed B-ALL compared with that in naive B-ALL. The three genes had a significantly worse survival (P < 0.05). The LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most predictive genes as prognostic indicators, and YTHDC1 and FTO were identified as prognostic factors for relapsed B-ALL. Finally, the results of multivariate regression analysis showed that the risk score of m6A methylation-related genes was an independent prognostic factor in relapsed B-ALL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We found that the expression levels of m6A methylation-related genes were different in naive and relapsed patients with B-ALL and correlated with survival and prognosis. This implies that m6A methylation-related genes may be promising prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets for relapsed B-ALL. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, biological aging has been quantified in DNA-methylation samples of older adults and applied as so-called "methylation profile scores" (MPSs) in separate target samples, including samples of children. This nascent research indicates that (1) biological aging can be quantified early in the life course, decades before the onset of aging-related disease, (2) is affected by common environmental predictors of childhood development, and (3) shows overlap with "developmental processes" (e.g., puberty). Because the MPSs were computed using algorithms developed in adults, these studies indicate a molecular link between childhood environments, development, and adult biological aging. Yet, if MPSs can be used to connect development and aging, previous research has only traveled one way, deriving MPSs developed in adults and applying them to samples of children. Researchers have not yet quantified epigenetic measures that reflect the pace of child development, and tested whether resulting MPSs are associated with physical and psychological aging. In this perspective I posit that combining measures of biological aging with new quantifications of child development has the power to address fundamental questions about life span: How are development and experience in childhood related to biological aging in adulthood? And what is aging? Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic position (SEP), which reflects one's position in society and access to resources, is strongly tied to neurodevelopment and is associated with epigenetic changes. AIM: This study examined whether DNA methylation signatures of prenatal SEP, measured in birth samples, are associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months of age. METHODS: Prenatal SEP DNA methylation scores were derived using 97 placenta and 127 cord blood biospecimens in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation cohort. Participants completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) at 36 months of age. Generalized regression analyses, adjusting for maternal age and race, were performed to test the association between SEP methylation score, for each birth biospecimen type, and MSEL and VABS scores. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between placenta SEP methylation score and MSEL Expressive Language outcomes (beta = -2.7, p = 0.046, 95% CI [- 5.43, -0.05]) and Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.5, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-4.82, -0.16]). In cord blood, methylation-SEP scores were significantly associated with Receptive Language outcomes (beta = -2.0, p = 0.037, 95% CI [-3.85, -0.12]). No significant associations were observed with VABS scores. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm associations between prenatal SEP and early childhood language development using a novel empiric DNA methylation measure of exposure. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - A prior study reported no association between prenatal smoking methylation scores and adult lung cancer risk adjusting for methylation-predicted adult smoking, without considering maternal smoking trends by birth cohort. To address this gap, we examined the association between prenatal smoking methylation scores and adult lung cancer, independent of methylation-predicted adult packyears and by birth cohort, in a study nested in CLUE II. Included were 208 incident lung cancer cases ascertained by cancer registry linkage and 208 controls matched on age, sex, and smoking. DNA methylation was measured in prediagnostic blood. We calculated two prenatal smoking scores, using 19 (Score-19) and 15 (Score-15) previously identified CpGs and a methylation-predicted adult packyears score. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for adult packyears score and batch effects. Score-15 was positively associated with lung cancer (per standard deviation, OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10-1.79, P-trend = .006), especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.55-7.60, P-trend = .002). Score-19 was associated only in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.15-3.91). Participants with both prenatal scores below the median (vs all other combinations) had lower risk (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.27-0.72), especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04-0.62). Among ever smokers, participants with higher prenatal smoking scores had higher risk, irrespective of adult packyears (low: OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.38-5.72, high: OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.03-6.95). This prospective study suggests a positive association between prenatal smoking exposure and adult lung cancer risk, especially in the 1930-1938 birth cohort, independent of active smoking. Future studies with multiple birth cohorts are needed.

AB  - Background: Psychosis is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Individuals with early-onset psychosis (EOP) tend to experience a worse prognosis and shorter life expectancy. The etiology of EOP remains unclear, but epigenetic mechanisms are known to serve as the interface between environmental exposures and biological processes to better understand its etiology. Objectives: We characterized the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as genome-wide epigenetic markers, in Mexican patients with EOP. Methods: We estimated epigenetic age, performed an epigenome-wide association study, and finally developed an epigenetic risk score (MRS) to predict manifestations of psychosis. Results: We found that patients with EOP have a higher epigenetic age using Wu's clock (p = 0.015). Moreover, accelerated epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age (PedBE clock, p = 0.046), global functioning (Wu's clock, p = 0.027), and psychiatric admissions (DNAmTL, p = 0.038). In addition, we observed that a reduction in years of schooling is associated with an increase on epigenetic age (Levine's clock, beta = 5.07, p = 0.001). In our epigenome-wide association study, we identified eight CpGs associated with EOP. Noteworthy, a psychosis-methylation risk score (EOP-MRS) was associated with panic disorder (beta = 1.36, p = 0.03), as well as auditory (beta = 1.28, p = 0.04) and visual (beta = 1.22, p = 0.04) hallucinations. Conclusions: Years of education have an impact on epigenetic age. Additionally, our study suggests associations of DNA methylation with EOP. Finally, we developed an MRS that associates clinical manifestations of psychosis.

AB  - Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) is a monogenic disorder arising from pathogenic variants within KMT2D and characterized by syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. We report the retrospective identification of a causative AluY insertion within KMT2D in a genetically unsolved individual with typical KS1 features, after identification of a DNA methylation signature. This is the first documentation of Alu insertion as a molecular mechanism responsible for KS1. This study emphasizes the need for reanalyzing inconclusive sequencing data in individuals with gene-specific phenotypes and reinforces episignature as a reliable diagnostic tool when NGS approaches fail to provide conclusive results in individuals with rare diseases.

AB  - In the pediatric population, BCL6-correpresor gene (BCOR)eupregulated tumors include primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumors/undifferentiated sarcomas (PMMTI/UND), clear cell sarcomas of the kidney (CCSK), and high-grade neuroepithelial tumors (HG-NET). We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) and copy number variation (CNV) profiling in these tumors (N = 34) using an Illumina EPIC BeadChip to better define the potential use of these tools to confirm diagnosis and predict outcomes. Twenty-seven tumors from 25 patients (age range, 0-10 years), showed molecular confirmation of genetic abnormalities as follows: BCOR internal tandem duplication in 14 PMMTI/UND, 8 CCSK, and 3 HG-NET and YWHAE fusions in 2 PMMTI/UND. The remaining 7 cases lacking informative molecular data were analyzed by immunophenotyping and were included in the study as a training cohort, clearly separated from the main study group. These were 4 PMMTI, 1 HG-NET, and 1 CCSK in which poor RNA preservation precluded the confirmation of BCOR rearrangements and 1 CCSK in which no rearrangements were found. DNAm data were compared with those of brain tumor and/or sarcoma classifier. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were analyzed in the 3 groups. Twenty-two cases of the 24 molecularly confirmed PMMTI/UND and CCSK and 3 of 6 of those with only immunophenotyping were classified within the methylation class "BCOR-altered sarcoma family" with optimal calibrated scores. PMMTI/UND and CCSK showed similar methylation profiles, whereas thousands of DMRs and significantly enriched pathways were evident between soft tissue/kidney tumors and HG-NET. The CNV analysis showed an overall flat profile in 19 of the 31 evaluable tumors (8/10 CCSK; 9/18 PMMTI/UND; 2/4 HG-NET). The most frequent CNVs were 1q gain and 9p and 10q loss. Follow-up time data were available for 20 patients: >= 2 CNV significantly correlated with a worse overall survival rate. In conclusion, soft tissue and kidney BCOR sarcomas matched with BCOR-altered sarcoma methylation class, whereas those from the brain matched with the central nervous system tumor classifier HG-NET BCOR, supporting the notion that DNAm profiling is an informative diagnostic tool. CNV alterations were associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

AB  - Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, the most severe group of epilepsies, are characterized by seizures and frequent epileptiform activity associated with developmental slowing or regression. Onset typically occurs in infancy or childhood and includes many well-defined epilepsy syndromes. Patients have wide-ranging comorbidities including intellectual disability, psychiatric features, such as autism spectrum disorder and behavioural problems, movement and musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal and sleep problems, together with an increased mortality rate. Problems change with age and patients require substantial support throughout life, placing a high psychosocial burden on parents, carers and the community. In many patients, the aetiology can be identified, and a genetic cause is found in >50% of patients using next-generation sequencing technologies. More than 900 genes have been identified as monogenic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and many cell components and processes have been implicated in their pathophysiology, including ion channels and transporters, synaptic proteins, cell signalling and metabolism and epigenetic regulation. Polygenic risk score analyses have shown that common variants also contribute to phenotypic variability. Holistic management, which encompasses antiseizure therapies and care for multimorbidities, is determined both by epilepsy syndrome and aetiology. Identification of the underlying aetiology enables the development of precision medicines to improve the long-term outcome of patients with these devastating diseases. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Background: It is known that being the adult child of a parent with an alcohol use disorder (ACoA) can confer a wide variety of increased health and psychological risks, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Additionally, ACoAs are at greater risk of developing alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) than individuals from families without a history of AUDs. Methods: ACoA individuals with risky hazardous alcohol use (n = 14) and those not engaged in hazardous use (n = 14) were compared to a group of healthy controls. We examined structural brain differences and applied machine learning algorithms to predict biological brain and DNA methylation ages to investigate differences and determine any accelerated aging between these groups. Results: Hazardous and non-hazardous ACoA groups had lower predicted brain ages than the healthy control group (n = 100), which may result from neuro-developmental differences between ACoA groups and controls. Within specific brain regions, we observed decreased cortical volume within bilateral pars orbitalis and frontal poles, and the left middle temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex within the hazardous alcohol ACoA group. When looking at the epigenetic aging data, the hazardous ACoA participants had increased predicted epigenetic age difference scores compared to the control group (n = 34) and the non-hazardous ACoA participant groups. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a decreased brain age in the ACoAs compared to control, concurrent with increased epigenetic age specifically in the hazardous ACoA group, laying the foundation for future research to identify individuals with an increased susceptibility to developing hazardous alcohol use. Together, these results provide a better understanding of the associations between epigenetic factors, brain structure, and alcohol use disorders.

AB  - Both genetic and environmental factors have been found to play a significant role in psychosis relapse, either independently or through their synergistic interaction. Recently, DNA methylation (DNAm) has been proposed through the calculation of methylation profile scores (MPS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of MPS as a surrogate marker of the biological impact of early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and obstetric complications, childhood adversity and toxic habits), with the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) relapse. 91 participants from a cohort of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with less than five years of evolution were classified as non-relapse (patients who had not experienced a relapse after 3 years of enrollment) or relapse (patients who relapsed during the 3-year follow-up). As inclusion criteria, patients fulfilled Andreasen's criteria of symptomatic remission. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was profiled and fourteen MPS reflecting environmental exposure were constructed including both early stressful life events (including stressful intrauterine conditions and delivery issues, childhood adversity) and toxic habits. Increased levels of MPS reflecting gestational diabetes (p = 0.009), hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (p = 0.004), pre-eclampsia (p = 0.049), early preterm birth (p = 0.030), childhood adversity abuse (p = 0.021) and all childhood adversity (p = 0.030) were significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse. Our study suggests that changes in specific methylation patterns may represent one of the biological mechanisms linking early stressful life events to an increased risk of relapse.

AB  - Renal cancer (RC) is the most lethal urological malignancy with 30% late diagnosis. Over 50% RCs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. Current RC detection relies on imaging while it lacks satisfactory sensitivity for detecting small-size tumors. A sensitive and robust diagnostic tool is needed to facilitate standardized RC early detection. Herein, we performed genome-wide methylation sequencing on both tissues and urine samples for RC DNA methylation makers discovery and developed a PCR-based RC early detector (RED) using a cohort of 93 RC and 35 non-RC urine samples. RED further achieved sensitivities of 82.2% and 80.7%, and specificities of 77.1% and 75% in a testing cohort (90 RC vs. 35 non-RC) and a validation cohort (119 RC vs. 48 non-RC), respectively. Importantly, RED exhibited 89.5% sensitivity for tumors in diameter <2 cm. It can detect 83.6% clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 75.0% of translocational renal cell carcinoma, 100% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, renal malignant masenchymomas and mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma. RED showed promising performance for RC detection with early stage and small size and have potential to be used in conjunction with imaging.

AB  - Pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGG) of the cerebellum are rare, and only a few cases have been documented in detail in the literature. A major differential diagnosis for poorly differentiated tumors in the cerebellum in children is medulloblastoma. In this study, we described the histological and molecular features of a series of five pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum. They actually showed histological and immunohistochemical features that overlapped with those of medulloblastomas and achieved high scores in NanoString-based medulloblastoma diagnostic assay. Methylation profiling demonstrated these tumors were heterogeneous epigenetically, clustering to GBM_MID, DMG_K27, and GBM_RTKIII methylation classes. MYCN amplification was present in one case, and PDGFRA amplification in another two cases. Interestingly, target sequencing showed that all tumors carried TP53 mutations. Our results highlight that pediatric high-grade gliomas of the cerebellum can mimic medulloblastomas at histological and transcriptomic levels. Our report adds to the rare number of cases in the literature of cerebellar HGGs in children. We recommend the use of both methylation array and TP53 screening in the differential diagnoses of poorly differentiated embryonal-like tumors of the cerebellum.

AB  - Background: Although cavitating ultrasonic aspirators are commonly used in neurosurgical procedures, the suitability of ultrasonic aspirator-derived tumor material for diagnostic procedures is still controversial. Here, we explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic aspirator-resected tumor tissue to classify otherwise discarded sample material by fast DNA methylation-based analysis using low pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. Methods: Ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens from pediatric patients undergoing brain tumor resection were subjected to low-pass nanopore whole genome sequencing. DNA methylation-based classification using a neural network classifier and copy number variation analysis were performed. Tumor purity was estimated from copy number profiles. Results were compared to microarray (EPIC)-based routine neuropathological histomorphological and molecular evaluation. Results: 19 samples with confirmed neuropathological diagnosis were evaluated. All samples were successfully sequenced and passed quality control for further analysis. DNA and sequencing characteristics from ultrasonic aspirator-derived specimens were comparable to routinely processed tumor tissue. Classification of both methods was concordant regarding methylation class in 17/19 (89%) cases. Application of a platform-specific threshold for nanopore-based classification ensured a specificity of 100%, whereas sensitivity was 79%. Copy number variation profiles were generated for all cases and matched EPIC results in 18/19 (95%) samples, even allowing the identification of diagnostically or therapeutically relevant genomic alterations. Conclusion: Methylation-based classification of pediatric CNS tumors based on ultrasonic aspirator-reduced and otherwise discarded tissue is feasible using time- and cost-efficient nanopore sequencing.

AB  - Preterm birth is closely associated with immune dysregulation in early life and subsequent learning and psychiatric disorders, but methods for stratifying infants at risk remain elusive. Epigenetic Scores (EpiScores) are relatively stable DNA methylation (DNAm)-based proxies of circulating proteins that can capture health-related exposures such as chronic inflammation. EpiScore of C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) is associated with inflammatory burden in early life, atypical brain development following preterm birth (encephalopathy of prematurity), and adult cognitive ability. To evaluate the utility of EpiScores for predicting cognition in children born preterm, we investigated relations between 43 neonatal saliva-based EpiScores known to associate with low gestational age, and cognition assessed at 2 and 5 years of age in a cohort of 232 preterm and term-born children. DNAm CRP was negatively associated with 5-year Mullen Scales of Early Learning Composite (ELC) (β = -0.273, p = 0.002). Association magnitudes were larger for children born earlier (DNAm CRP x gestational age, βinteraction = 0.181). EpiScores of CRTAM, NCAM1 and SLITRK5 were also associated with 5-year ELC in the full cohort (absolute β range 0.219 to 0.267, Bonferroni-adjusted p-values <0.01). For preterm children, associations for DNAm CRP (β = -0.318, p = 0.021) and DNAm CRTAM (β = -0.307, p = 0.006) with 5-year ELC remained significant after adjustment for inflammatory exposures. We demonstrate associations between a range of neonatal salivary EpiScores and childhood cognition, suggesting the clinical value of EpiScores as early life markers of cognitive ability in children at risk of impairment warrants further investigation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Variable expressivity is an emerging characteristic of KMT2B-related dystonia. However, it remains poorly understood whether variants reoccurring at specific sites of lysine-specific methlytransferase-2B (KMT2B) can drive intra- and interfamilial clinical heterogeneity. Our goal was to ascertain independent families with variants affecting residue Arg2565 of KMT2B. METHODS: Whole-exome/genome sequencing, multi-site recruitment, genotype-phenotype correlations, and DNA methylation episignature analysis were performed. RESULTS: We report four individuals from two families harboring the variant c.7693C > G, p.Arg2565Gly. In an additional patient, a de-novo c.7693C > T, p.Arg2565Cys variant was identified. The observed phenotypic spectrum ranged from childhood-onset dystonia (N = 2) over unspecific intellectual disability syndromes (N = 2) to undiagnosed behavioral symptoms in adulthood (N = 1). Samples bearing p.Arg2565Gly had a KMT2B-typical episignature, although the effect on methylation was less pronounced than in carriers of loss-of-function KMT2B variants. CONCLUSIONS: We established the existence of a KMT2B missense-mutation hotspot associated with varying degrees of disease severity and expression, providing information for patient counseling and elucidation of pathomechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation levels at specific sites can be used to proxy C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, providing a potentially more stable and accurate indicator of sustained inflammation and associated health risk. However, its use has been primarily limited to adults or preterm infants, and little is known about determinants for - or offspring outcomes of - elevated levels of this epigenetic proxy in cord blood. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map prenatal predictors and long-term neurobehavioral outcomes of neonatal inflammation, as assessed with an epigenetic proxy of inflammation in cord blood, in the general pediatric population. METHODS: Our study was embedded in the prospective population-based Generation R Study (n = 2,394). We created a methylation profile score of CRP (MPS-CRP) in cord blood as a marker of neonatal inflammation and validated it against serum CRP levels in mothers during pregnancy, as well as offspring at birth and in childhood. We then examined (i) which factors (previously associated with sustained inflammation) explain variability in MPS-CRP at birth, including a wide range of prenatal lifestyle and clinical conditions, pro-inflammatory exposures, as well as child genetic liability to elevated CRP levels; and (ii) whether MPS-CRP at birth associates with child neurobehavioral outcomes, including global structural MRI and DTI measures (child mean age 10 and 14 years) as well as psychiatric symptoms over time (Child Behavioral Checklist, at mean age 1.5, 3, 6, 10 and 14 years). RESULTS: MPS-CRP at birth was validated with serum CRP in cord blood (cut-off > 1 mg/L) (AUC = 0.72). Prenatal lifestyle pro-inflammatory factors explained a small part (i.e., < 5%) of the variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. No other prenatal predictor or the polygenic score of CRP in the child explained significant variance in the MPS-CRP at birth. The MPS-CRP at birth prospectively associated with a reduction in global fractional anisotropy over time on mainly a nominal threshold (beta = -0.014, SE = 0.007, p = 0.032), as well as showing nominal associations with structural differences (amygdala [(beta = 0.016, SE = 0.006, p = 0.010], cerebellum [(beta = -0.007, SE = 0.003, p = 0.036]). However, no associations with child psychiatric symptoms were observed. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to lifestyle-related pro-inflammatory factors was the only prenatal predictor that accounted for some of the individual variability in MPS-CRP levels at birth. Further, while the MPS-CRP prospectively associated with white matter alterations over time, no associations were observed at the behavioral level. Thus, the relevance and potential utility of using epigenetic data as a marker of neonatal inflammation in the general population remain unclear. In the future, the use of epigenetic proxies for a wider range of immune markers may lend further insights into the relationship between neonatal inflammation and adverse neurodevelopment within the general pediatric population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections during pregnancy have been robustly associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes in offspring, yet the underlying molecular pathways remain largely unknown. Here, we examined whether exposure to common infections in utero associates with DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns at birth and whether this in turn relates to offspring health outcomes in the general population. METHODS: Using data from 2,367 children from the Dutch population-based Generation R Study, we first performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify differentially methylated sites and regions at birth associated with prenatal infection exposure. We also examined the influence of infection timing by using self-reported cumulative infection scores for each trimester. Second, we sought to develop an aggregate methylation profile score (MPS) based on cord blood DNAm as an epigenetic proxy of prenatal infection exposure and tested whether this MPS prospectively associates with offspring health outcomes, including psychiatric symptoms, BMI, and asthma at ages 13-16 years. Third, we investigated whether prenatal infection exposure associates with offspring epigenetic age acceleration - a marker of biological aging. Across all analysis steps, we tested whether our findings replicate in 864 participants from an independent population-based cohort (ALSPAC, UK). RESULTS: We observed no differentially methylated sites or regions in cord blood in relation to prenatal infection exposure, after multiple testing correction. 33 DNAm sites showed suggestive associations (p < 5e10 - 5; of which one was also nominally associated in ALSPAC), indicating potential links to genes associated with immune, neurodevelopmental, and cardiovascular pathways. While the MPS of prenatal infections associated with maternal reports of infections in the internal hold out sample in the Generation R Study (R2incremental = 0.049), it did not replicate in ALSPAC (R2incremental = 0.001), and it did not prospectively associate with offspring health outcomes in either cohort. Moreover, we observed no association between prenatal exposure to infections and epigenetic age acceleration across cohorts and clocks. CONCLUSION: In contrast to prior studies, which reported DNAm differences in offspring exposed to severe infections in utero, we do not find evidence for associations between self-reported clinically evident common infections during pregnancy and DNAm or epigenetic aging in cord blood within the general pediatric population. Future studies are needed to establish whether associations exist but are too subtle to be statistically meaningful with present sample sizes, whether they replicate in a cohort with a more similar infection score as our discovery cohort, whether they occur in different tissues than cord blood, and whether other biological pathways may be more relevant for mediating the effect of prenatal common infection exposure on downstream offspring health outcomes.

AB  - Forensic age estimation of stain donors through DNA methylation has been intensively studied in recent years. To date, there are many published age estimation tools which are based on technologies including pyrosequencing, minisequencing, or MPS. With the implementation of such tools into routine forensic casework in many laboratories worldwide, there is a need for thorough evaluation and performance comparison. In this study, we tested published age estimation tools that are based on either minisequencing or MPS on four body fluids (blood, saliva, buccal cells and semen). All samples were analyzed with both technologies and the age estimates were compared. Biological replicates were taken from ten (blood, saliva, buccal cells) or 12 individuals (semen) to assess the reproducibility of each tool. Our study demonstrates high accuracy in estimating chronological age for various body fluids using both technologies, except for semen. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) ranged from three to five years for blood, saliva and buccal cells, while semen exhibited a higher MAE of seven to eight years. Despite the overall good performance for blood, saliva, and buccal cells, significant discrepancies were observed for some individuals both between the two technologies or when compared to their chronological age. Conclusively, we demonstrated that forensic age estimation tools based on two different technologies are similarly accurate for blood, saliva and buccal cells, while the semen tools need some adjustments before implementation into forensic casework. Our results could be helpful in the decision-making process for laboratories seeking to newly establish an age estimation workflow.

AB  - Increasing evidence implicates prenatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common endocrine-disrupting plastic chemical, in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examined whether cord blood DNA methylation, a key epigenetic marker, mediates the association between prenatal DEHP exposure and ASD/ADHD symptoms in 847 children enrolled in the Barwon Infant Study. ASD and ADHD are complex phenotypes characterised by differences at the gene regulatory network and neuronal circuit level, where heterogeneous genetic and environmental risk factors converge. Accordingly, we employed a data-driven computational strategy that helped elucidate broader functional epigenetic signatures of ASD and ADHD elicited by DEHP exposure. This included (1) a methylation profile score for DEHP exposure (MPSDEHP), and (2) an analysis of co-methylated gene networks. Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that both MPSDEHP and a DEHP-associated network of co-methylated genes mediated the effect of DEHP exposure on increased ASD and ADHD symptoms at ages 2 and 4 years (proportion of effect mediated ranged from 0.21 to 0.80). The co-methylation network was enriched for neural cell-type markers, ASD risk genes (including FOXP1, SHANK2, and PLXNB1), and targets of endocrine receptors previously linked to DEHP (including targets of the estrogen receptor ERα and the glucocorticoid receptor GR), providing biological plausibility. We validated key results in independent blood (n=66) and postmortem brain (n=40) DNA methylation datasets. These findings provide mechanistic evidence linking DEHP to ASD and ADHD symptoms and reinforce growing concerns regarding the risks of prenatal exposure.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of melanoma risk have identified 68 independent signals at 54 loci. For most loci, specific functional variants and their respective target genes remain to be established. Capture-HiC is an assay that links fine-mapped risk variants to candidate target genes by comprehensively mapping chromatin interactions. We performed a melanoma GWAS region-focused capture-HiC assay in human primary melanocytes to identify physical interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and potential causal melanoma-susceptibility genes. Overall, chromatin-interaction data alone nominated potential causal genes for 61 of the 68 melanoma risk signals, identifying many candidates beyond those reported by previous studies. We further integrated these data with epigenomic (chromatin state, accessibility), gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTL]/transcriptome-wide association study [TWAS]), DNA methylation (methylation QTL [meQTL]/methylome-wide association study [MWAS]), and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data generated from melanoma-relevant cell types to prioritize potentially cis-regulatory variants and their respective candidate gene targets. From the set of fine-mapped variants across these loci, we identified 140 prioritized credible causal variants linked to 195 candidate genes at 42 risk signals. In addition, we developed an integrative scoring system to facilitate candidate gene prioritization, integrating melanocyte and melanoma datasets. Notably, at several GWAS risk signals, we observed long-range chromatin connections (500 kb to >1 Mb) with distant candidate target genes. We validated several such cis-regulatory interactions using CRISPR inhibition, providing evidence for known cancer driver genes MDM4 and CBL, as well as the SRY-box transcription factor SOX4, as likely melanoma risk genes.

AB  - Weiss-Kruszka Syndrome (WSKA) is caused by pathogenic variants in ZNF462 representing a rare autosomal dominant congenital anomaly syndrome. It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and craniofacial abnormalities, documented in fewer than 30 patients. ZNF462, located on chromosome 9p31.2, is a transcription factor and has an important role during embryonic development and chromatin remodelling. Here, we report three new patients with WSKA, Through whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, we identified two novel variants in three patients, two of whom are siblings. These variants (c.3078dup, p.Val1027Cysfs5 and c.4792A > T p.Lys1598*) in the ZNF462 gene are likely resulting in haploinsufficiency. Our patients help to further delineate the phenotype, genotype and potential therapeutic management strategies for WSKA. Since we report a second WSKA patient with an autoimmune disease further clinical and functional studies are needed to elucidate the association between this chromatin remodelling disorder and the development of autoimmune problems. In the future, collaborative efforts are encouraged to develop an episignature for WSKA, given the gene's function and associated patient phenotypes. This new technology has the potential to provide valuable insights into the disorder. Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in TCF4, leading to intellectual disability, specific morphological features, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in PTHS, prompting the investigation of a DNA methylation (DNAm) "episignature" specific to PTHS for diagnostic purposes and variant reclassification and functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. A cohort of 67 individuals with genetically confirmed PTHS and three individuals with intellectual disability and a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in TCF4 were studied. The DNAm episignature was developed with an Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip array analysis using peripheral blood cells. Support vector machine (SVM) modeling and clustering methods were employed to generate a DNAm classifier for PTHS. Validation was extended to an additional cohort of 11 individuals with PTHS. The episignature was assessed in relation to other neurodevelopmental disorders and its specificity was examined. A specific DNAm episignature for PTHS was established. The classifier exhibited high sensitivity for TCF4 haploinsufficiency and missense variants in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain. Notably, seven individuals with TCF4 variants exhibited negative episignatures, suggesting complexities related to mosaicism, genetic factors, and environmental influences. The episignature displayed degrees of overlap with other related disorders and biological pathways. This study defines a DNAm episignature for TCF4-related PTHS, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and VUS reclassification. The finding that some cases scored negatively underscores the potential for multiple or nested episignatures and emphasizes the need for continued investigation to enhance specificity and coverage across PTHS-related variants.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without autism or seizures (NEDAUS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, speech delay, seizures, autistic features, and/or behavior abnormalities. It is caused by CUL3 (Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase) haploinsufficiency. We collected clinical and molecular data from 26 individuals carrying pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the CUL3 gene, including 20 previously unreported cases. By comparing their DNA methylation (DNAm) classifiers with those of healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by established episignatures, we aimed to create a diagnostic biomarker (episignature) and gain more knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology. We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for patients with pathogenic variants in CUL3 and utilized it to reclassify patients carrying a VUS in the CUL3 gene. Comparative epigenomic analysis revealed similarities between NEDAUS and several other rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with previously identified episignatures, highlighting the broader implication of our findings. In addition, we performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies to explain the variety in clinical presentation between the cases. We discovered a highly accurate DNAm episignature serving as a robust diagnostic biomarker for NEDAUS. Furthermore, we broadened the phenotypic spectrum by identifying 20 new individuals and confirming five previously reported cases of NEDAUS. Crown Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mendelian disorders, arising from pathogenic variations within single genetic loci, often manifest as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), affecting a significant portion of the pediatric population worldwide. These disorders are marked by atypical brain development, intellectual disabilities, and various associated phenotypic traits. Genetic testing aids in clinical diagnoses, but inconclusive results can prolong confirmation processes. Recent focus on epigenetic dysregulation has led to the discovery of DNA methylation signatures, or episignatures, associated with NDDs, accelerating diagnostic precision. Notably, TRIP12 and USP7, genes involved in the ubiquitination pathway, exhibit specific episignatures. Understanding the roles of these genes within the ubiquitination pathway sheds light on their potential influence on episignature formation. While TRIP12 acts as an E3 ligase, USP7 functions as a deubiquitinase, presenting contrasting roles within ubiquitination. Comparison of phenotypic traits in patients with pathogenic variations in these genes reveals both distinctions and commonalities, offering insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review contextualizes the roles of TRIP12 and USP7 within the ubiquitination pathway, their influence on episignature formation, and the potential implications for NDD pathogenesis. Understanding these intricate relationships may unveil novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic strategies for NDDs. Copyright © 2024 van der Laan, ten Voorde, Mannens and Henneman.

AB  - PURPOSE: ARID1A/ARID1B haploinsufficiency leads to Coffin-Siris syndrome, duplications of ARID1A lead to a distinct clinical syndrome, whilst ARID1B duplications have not yet been linked to a phenotype. METHODS: We collected patients with duplications encompassing ARID1A and ARID1B duplications. RESULTS: 16 ARID1A and 13 ARID1B duplication cases were included with duplication sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 Mb (1-44 genes) for ARID1A and 0.9 to 10.3 Mb (2-101 genes) for ARID1B. Both groups shared features, with ARID1A patients having more severe intellectual disability, growth delay, and congenital anomalies. DNA methylation analysis showed that ARID1A patients had a specific methylation pattern in blood, which differed from controls and from patients with ARID1A or ARID1B loss-of-function variants. ARID1B patients appeared to have a distinct methylation pattern, similar to ARID1A duplication patients, but further research is needed to validate these results. Five cases with duplications including ARID1A or ARID1B initially annotated as duplications of uncertain significance were evaluated using PhenoScore and DNA methylation reanalysis, resulting in the reclassification of 2 ARID1A and 2 ARID1B duplications as pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that ARID1B duplications manifest a clinical phenotype, and ARID1A duplications have a distinct episignature that overlaps with that of ARID1B duplications, providing further evidence for a distinct and emerging BAFopathy caused by whole-gene duplication rather than haploinsufficiency.

AB  - Rare variants affecting the epigenetic regulator KDM2B cause a recently delineated neurodevelopmental disorder. Interestingly, we previously identified both a general KDM2B-associated episignature and a subsignature specific to variants in the DNA-binding CxxC domain. In light of the existence of a distinct subsignature, we set out to determine if KDM2B CxxC variants are associated with a unique phenotype and disease mechanism. We recruited individuals with heterozygous CxxC variants and assessed the variants' effect on protein expression and DNA-binding ability. We analyzed clinical data from 19 individuals, including ten previously undescribed individuals with seven novel CxxC variants. The core phenotype of the KDM2B-CxxC cohort is more extensive as compared to that of individuals with KDM2B haploinsufficiency. All individuals with CxxC variants presented with developmental delay, mainly in the speech and motor domain, in addition to variable intellectual disability and mild facial dysmorphism. Congenital heart defects were observed in up to 78% of individuals, with additional common findings including musculoskeletal, ophthalmological, and urogenital anomalies, as well as behavioral challenges and feeding difficulties. Functional assays revealed that while mutant KDM2B protein with CxxC variants can be expressed in vitro, its DNA-binding ability is significantly reduced compared to wildtype. This study shows that KDM2B CxxC variants cause a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome, possibly through a molecular mechanism different from haploinsufficiency.

AB  - Background: While the association between caregiver-child interaction and early childhood development (ECD) has been observed, the underlying biological mechanism remains to be elucidated. Objective: This study aimed to examine the potential role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation in the association between caregiver-child interaction and ECD among preschool children living in rural China. Methods: This study was conducted in a rural area in Central China. ECD was evaluated with the Gesell Development Diagnosis Scale (Chinese version), yielding a developmental quotient (DQ), i.e. global neurodevelopmental score (NDS). Caregiver-child interaction was assessed using the Brigance Parent-Child Interaction Scale. Of the 171 children aged 3–6 years who participated in ECD assessment and blood samples collection, a total of 64 were selected for epigenome-wide association study with Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip array (850 K). The linear regression model in the R package “CpGassoc”was applied to identify CpG sites associated with global NDS and caregiver-child interaction. The causal inference test (CIT) was utilized to explore the potential mediation effect of DNA methylation. Results: Our epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 844 CpG sites significantly associated with children’s global NDS (PFDR<0.05), while no CpG sites were found to be directly related to caregiver-child interaction after FDR correction. Mediation analysis indicated that 395 CpG sites mediated the association between caregiver-child interaction and children’s ECD before FDR correction; and among the genes with top 20 CpG sites, genes CFAP45 (cg07740897), PCDH9 (cg20666533), LAMC3 (cg14447608), FAM19A5 (cg13192640), PRKG1 (cg09071556), PLEKHG5 (cg05151739), TCERG1 (cg09189322), and MTRR (cg08075506) have been reported to be associated with neurodevelopment and related diseases. Conclusions: Blood DNA methylation may mediate the association between caregiver-child interaction and ECD in preschool children. This provides population-level epigenetic evidence supporting parenting interventions for vulnerable preschool children who experience poor caregiver-child interaction, aiming to ensure optimal early development potential. However, future studies in diverse populations are needed to validate these findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Polycomb group proteins are key epigenetic transcriptional regulators. Multiple neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with pathogenic variants of the genes encoding Polycomb group proteins. RYBP is a core component of the noncanonical Polycomb Repressor Complex 1; however, its role in disease is unclear. METHODS: Functional consequences of RYBP variants were assessed using in vitro cellular and in vivo Drosophila melanogaster studies. RESULTS: We described 7 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants of RYBP and their clinical findings, including severe developmental delay, dysmorphisms, and multiple congenital anomalies. We showed that all single-nucleotide variants in RYBP localize to the N-terminal domain of the gene, which encodes the zinc-finger domain and ubiquitin-binding moiety. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the RYBP c.132C>G p.(Cys44Trp) variant causes reduced protein expression but does not affect the binding of YY1, RING1B, or ubiquitin. In vivo overexpression studies in Drosophila melanogaster showed a dramatic functional difference between human RYBP and its variant forms, affecting the C44 amino acid residue. DNA methylation studies suggested a possible episignature associated with RYBP-related disorder. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous de novo variants in RYBP are associated with an identifiable syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder with multiple congenital anomalies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic algorithms of aging, health, and cognition, based on DNA-methylation (DNAm) patterns, are prominent tools for measuring biological age and have been linked to age-related diseases, cognitive decline, and mortality. While most of these methylation profile scores (MPSs) are developed in blood tissue, there is growing interest in using less invasive tissues like saliva. The aim of the current study is to probe the cross-tissue intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of MPSs developed in blood applied to saliva DNAm from the same people. While our primary focus is on MPSs that were previously found to be robustly correlated with social determinants of health, including second- and third-generation clocks and MPSs of physiology and cognition, we also report ICC values for first-generation clocks to enable comparison across metrics. We pooled three publicly available datasets that had both saliva and blood DNAm from the same individuals (total n = 107, aged 5-74 years), corrected MPSs for cell composition within each tissue, and computed the cross-tissue ICCs. RESULTS: We found that after correcting for cell composition, saliva-blood cross-tissue ICCs were moderate for second- and third-generation indices of aging and MPSs of physiology and cognition. Specifically, PCGrimAge had the highest ICC (0.76), followed by PCPhenoAge (0.72), a measure of cognitive performance (Epigenetic-g, 0.69), DunedinPACE (0.68), PCGrimAge Acceleration (0.67), PCPhenoAge Acceleration (0.66), an MPS of hs-CRP (0.58), and BMI (0.54). These ICCs appear lower than previous reports on within-tissue ICCs (saliva ICCs range from 0.67 to 0.85, blood ICCs range from 0.73 to 0.93). Cross-tissue ICCs values for first-generation biological age acceleration measures were poor, ranging from 0.19 to 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that applying second- and third-generation MPSs of biological age acceleration and related phenotypes developed in blood to saliva DNAm results in moderate cross-tissue similarity and the precise cross-tissue correspondence differs by measure. While the degree of cross-tissue similarity of several MPSs may suffice for some research settings, it may not be suitable in clinical or commercial applications. Collection of both blood and saliva DNAm samples is necessary to validate existing algorithms and to customize MPSs in saliva DNAm. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Differentiating between monozygotic (MZ) twins remains difficult because they have the same genetic makeup. Applying the traditional STR genotyping approach cannot differentiate one from the other. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of two or more different mtDNA copies within a single cell and this phenomenon is common in humans. The levels of heteroplasmy cannot change dramatically during transmission in the female germ line but increase or decrease during germ-line transmission and in somatic tissues during life. As massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology has advanced, it has shown the extraordinary quantity of mtDNA heteroplasmy in humans. In this study, a probe hybridization technique was used to obtain mtDNA and then MPS was performed with an average sequencing depth of above 4000. The results showed us that all ten pairs of MZ twins were clearly differentiated with the minor heteroplasmy threshold at 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Finally, we used a probe that targeted mtDNA to boost sequencing depth without interfering with nuclear DNA and this technique can be used in forensic genetics to differentiate the MZ twins.

AB  - Introduction: Current guidelines recommend broad sequencing as a first-tier test for epilepsy, identifying a genetic etiology in 40% of cases. Sequencing subsequently increases the number of patients identified with variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). Clinicians desire additional investigatory methods to better classify these VUSs. Case Presentation: The HNRNPU gene (MIM #602869) is associated with a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, epilepsy, and characteristic facial features. To date, only de novo variants with complete penetrance have been described. We present a 7-year-old female with HNRNPU variant c.669-691dup; p.Gly231- Valfs∗116, classified as both pathogenic (Laboratory A) and as a VUS (Laboratory B). This patient exhibits an isolated seizure phenotype, and familial studies revealed the proband's father (asymptomatic), paternal uncle (epilepsy), and paternal grandmother (asymptomatic) all carry this variant. Laboratory B theorized the potential for alternative splicing, reducing concerns about pathogenicity. Methylation studies were pursued for more accurate classification and are conclusively negative for the HNRNPU episignature. This, in the context of the variant not segregating with the familial epilepsy phenotype, indicates a benign classification for the c.669-691dup; p.Gly231Valfs∗116 variant. Conclusion: The number of epilepsy patients with nondiagnostic genetic results requires additional modes of investigation. Reclassification often takes years due to the novelty of variants identified. This case highlights the importance of laboratory scrutiny when multiple variants are detected, the need for greater data sharing between laboratories to reduce inconsistent classifications, and the utility of ancillary testing, such as methylation studies, to aid in VUS reclassification.

AB  - Plastics found in our everyday environment are becoming an increasing concern for individual and population-level health, and the extent of exposure and potential toxic effects of these contaminants on numerous human organ systems are becoming clear. Microplastics (MPs), tiny plastic particles, appear to have many of the same biological effects as their plastic precursors and have the compounded effect of potential accumulation in different organs. Recently, microplastic accumulation was observed in the human placenta, raising important questions related to the biological effects of these contaminants on the health of pregnancies and offspring. These concerns are particularly heightened considering the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) framework, which postulates that in utero exposure can programme the lifelong health of the offspring. The current review examines the state of knowledge on this topic and highlights important avenues for future investigation.
