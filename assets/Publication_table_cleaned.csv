Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes have identifiable patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) change: DNAm signatures or episignatures. Given the role of KANSL1 in histone acetylation, we tested whether variants underlying KdVS are associated with a DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 13 individuals with KANSL1 variants, four individuals with 17q21.31 microdeletions, and 21 typically developing individuals, using Illumina’s Infinium EPIC array. In this study, we identified a robust DNAm signature of 456 significant CpG sites in 8 individuals with KdVS, a pattern independently validated in an additional 7 individuals with KdVS. We also demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the signature and classify two KANSL1 VUS as well as four variants in individuals with atypical clinical presentation. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific DNAm changes in fibroblast cells from individuals with KdVS. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the epigenetic landscape related to KdVS and aid in the diagnosis and classification of variants in this structurally complex genomic region.","['Awamleh, Z.', 'Choufani, S.', 'Wu, W.', 'Rots, D.', 'Dingemans, A.

We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative of in utero exposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (n = 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (n = 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (n = 583). RESULTS: The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, p = 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, p = 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, p < 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.

Despite their distinct clinical presentations, we propose that ASXL1 mutations drive common epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in BOS and AML. We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA-seq data from BOS patients (n=13) and controls (n=38) and publicly available DNAm of AML cases with (n=3) and without (n=3) ASXL1 mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and RNA-seq data from AML cases (n=27) from the Beat AML cohort. Using a DNA-methylation based episignature that we previously developed for BOS, we clustered AML, BOS and normal controls together. We showed that AML samples with ASXL1 mutations clustered closest to individuals with BOS, whereas individuals with AML without ASXL1 mutations clustered separately. We also observe common dysregulation of the transcriptome between BOS and AML with ASXL1 mutations compared to controls. Our transcriptomic analysis identified 821 significantly differentially expressed genes that were shared between both data sets and 74.9% showed differential expression in the same direction. BOS patients are rare and have some reports of tumors but no clear guidelines on cancer screening protocols. This represents the first direct comparison between distinct diseases that show common epigenetic and transcriptomic effects, and potentially common drug targets for patients harboring ASXL1 mutations on the epigenome and transcriptome.","['Lin, I.', 'Awamleh, Z.', 'Wei, A.', 'Russell, B.', 'Weksberg, R.', 'Arboleda, V.

The first individuals ascertained carried de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in HNRNPK. Here, we report 32 individuals with AKS (26 previously unpublished), including 13 with de novo missense variants. We propose new clinical diagnostic criteria for AKS that differentiate it from the clinically overlapping Kabuki syndrome and describe a significant phenotypic expansion to include individuals with missense variants who present with subtle facial features and few or no malformations. Many gene-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures have been identified for neurodevelopmental syndromes. Because HNRNPK has roles in chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hypothesized that pathogenic variants in HNRNPK may be associated with a specific DNAm signature. Here, we report a unique DNAm signature for AKS due to LoF HNRNPK variants, distinct from controls and Kabuki syndrome. This DNAm signature is also identified in some individuals with de novo HNRNPK missense variants, confirming their pathogenicity and the phenotypic expansion of AKS to include more subtle phenotypes. Furthermore, we report that some individuals with missense variants have an “intermediate” DNAm signature that parallels their milder clinical presentation, suggesting the presence of an epi-genotype phenotype correlation. In summary, the AKS DNAm signature may help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of AKS. This DNAm signature also effectively supported clinical syndrome delineation and is a valuable aid for variant interpretation in individuals where a clinical diagnosis of AKS is unclear, particularly for mild presentations.","['Choufani, S.', 'McNiven, V.', 'Cytrynbaum, C.', 'Jangjoo, M.', 'Adam, M.

However, the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking on child brain development has yet to be elucidated. Objective: To investigate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring brain development in preadolescence as well as the mediating pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis. Exposures: Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score. Results: The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring.","['Zou, R.', 'Boer, O. D.', 'Felix, J.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype-specific episignature.

Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites, which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1× log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (P = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance - thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity. Similarly, it may also function in monitoring the recently envisioned treatment of KMT2B deficiency by inhibition of DNA methylation.","['Mirza-Schreiber, N.', 'Zech, M.', 'Wilson, R.', 'Brunet, T.', 'Wagner, M.', 'Jech, R.', 'Boesch, S.', 'Škorvánek, M.', 'Necpál, J.', 'Weise, D.', 'Weber, S.', 'Mollenhauer, B.', 'Trenkwalder, C.', 'Maier, E.

It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error and bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalised linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates.","['Bernabeu, E.', 'Chybowska, A.

While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures. This study highlights the importance of mapping not only of the epigenome but also the exposome and extending the observational timeframe to well before birth.

Heterozygous variants in lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), encoding a histone H3 methyltransferase, have been associated with a childhood-onset, progressive and complex form of dystonia (dystonia 28, DYT28). Since 2016, more than one hundred rare KMT2B variants have been reported, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense and other in-frame changes, many having an uncertain clinical impact. RESULTS: We characterize the genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of a cohort of 18 patients with pathogenic and unclassified KMT2B variants. We resolve the ""episignature"" associated with KMT2B haploinsufficiency, proving that this approach is robust in diagnosing clinically unsolved cases, properly classifying them with respect to other partially overlapping dystonic phenotypes, other rare neurodevelopmental disorders and healthy controls. Notably, defective KMT2B function in DYT28 causes a non-random DNA hypermethylation across the genome, selectively involving promoters and other regulatory regions positively controlling gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinctive DNA hypermethylation pattern associated with DYT28, provide an epigenetic signature for this disorder enabling accurate diagnosis and reclassification of ambiguous genetic findings and suggest potential therapeutic approaches.

Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rare KMT2A variants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature for KMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2A gene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease.","['Foroutan, A.', 'Haghshenas, S.', 'Bhai, P.', 'Levy, M.

Methods: Through an international collaboration, clinical and molecular data from 20 individuals were systematically gathered, and a comparative analysis was conducted between this series and existing literature. We further scrutinized peripheral blood DNA methylation profile of individuals with BCL11B-RD, contrasting them with healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders marked by established episignature. Results: Our findings unveil rarely documented clinical manifestations, notably including Rubinstein-Taybi-like facial features, craniosynostosis, and autoimmune disorders, all manifesting within the realm of BCL11B-RD. We refine the intricacies of T cell compartment alterations of BCL11B-RD, revealing decreased levels naive CD4+ T cells and recent thymic emigrants while concurrently observing an elevated proportion of effector-memory expressing CD45RA CD8+ T cells (TEMRA). Finally, a distinct DNA methylation episignature exclusive to BCL11B-RD is unveiled. Conclusion: This study serves to enrich our comprehension of the clinico-biological landscape of BCL11B-RD, potentially furnishing a more precise framework for diagnosis and follow-up of individuals carrying pathogenic BCL11B variant. Moreover, the identification of a unique DNA methylation episignature offers a valuable diagnosis tool for BCL11B-RD, thereby facilitating routine clinical practice by empowering physicians to reevaluate variants of uncertain significance within the BCL11B gene.","['Sabbagh, Q.', 'Haghshenas, S.', 'Piard, J.', 'Trouvé, C.', 'Amiel, J.', 'Attié-Bitach, T.', 'Balci, T.', 'Barat-Houari, M.', 'Belonis, A.', 'Boute, O.', 'Brightman, D.

However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them. METHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score > 0.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (< 40), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (> 40), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated. Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age < 40 and lack of TERT promoter mutation. CONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients' risk.

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.","['Giuili, E.', 'Grolaux, R.', 'Macedo, C.

DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming. Methods: Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings. Results: Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e−05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e−07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e−04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.","['Alfano, R.', 'Zugna, D.', 'Barros, H.', 'Bustamante, M.', 'Chatzi, L.', 'Ghantous, A.', 'Herceg, Z.', 'Keski-Rahkonen, P.', 'de Kok, T.

Methods: Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified. Results: Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data. Conclusion: Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis.

Pregnant women disproportionately underreport smoking and smokers tend to have lower follow-up rates to repeat questionnaires. Missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data on presence and duration of smoking in pregnancy impairs identification of novel health effects and limits adjustment for smoking in studies of other pregnancy exposures. An objective biomarker in newborns of maternal smoking during pregnancy would be valuable. OBJECTIVES: We developed a biomarker of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy using common DNA methylation platforms. METHODS: Using a dimension reduction method, we developed and tested a numeric score in newborns to reflect sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy from data on cotinine, a short-term smoking biomarker measured mid-pregnancy, and Illumina450K cord blood DNA methylation from newborns in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). RESULTS: This score reliably predicted smoking status in the training set (n = 1,057; accuracy = 96%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 98%). Sensitivity (58%) was predictably lower in the much smaller test set (n = 221), but accuracy (91%) and specificity (97%) remained high. Reduced birth weight, a well-known effect of maternal smoking, was as strongly related to the score as to cotinine. A three-site score had lower, but acceptable, performance (accuracytrain = 82%, accuracytest = 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Our smoking methylation score represents a promising novel biomarker of sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy easily calculated with Illumina450K or IlluminaEPIC data. It may help identify novel health impacts and improve adjustment for smoking when studying other risk factors with more subtle effects.","['Reese, S. E.', 'Zhao, S.', 'Wu, M. C.', 'Joubert, B.

Here we report our experience using episignature analysis to resolve both uncomplicated and complex cases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). We analyzed 97 NDDs divided into (1) a validation cohort of 59 patients with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants characterized by a known episignature and (2) a test cohort of 38 patients harboring variants of unknown significance or unidentified variants. The expected episignature was obtained in most cases with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (53/59 [90%]), a revealing exception being the overlapping profile of two SMARCB1 pathogenic variants with ARID1A/B:c.6200, confirmed by the overlapping clinical features. In the test cohort, five cases showed the expected episignature, including (1) novel pathogenic variants in ARID1B and BRWD3; (2) a deletion in ATRX causing MRXFH1 X-linked mental retardation; and (3) confirmed the clinical diagnosis of Cornelia de Lange (CdL) syndrome in mutation-negative CdL patients. Episignatures analysis of the in BAF complex components revealed novel functional protein interactions and common episignatures affecting homologous residues in highly conserved paralogous proteins (SMARCA2 M856V and SMARCA4 M866V). Finally, we also found sex-dependent episignatures in X-linked disorders. Implementation of episignature profiling is still in its early days, but with increasing utilization comes increasing awareness of the capacity of this methodology to help resolve the complex challenges of genetic diagnoses.","['Trajkova, S.', 'Kerkhof, J.', 'Rossi Sebastiano, M.', 'Pavinato, L.', 'Ferrero, E.', 'Giovenino, C.', 'Carli, D.', 'Di Gregorio, E.', 'Marinoni, R.', 'Mandrile, G.', 'Palermo, F.', 'Carestiato, S.', 'Cardaropoli, S.', 'Pullano, V.', 'Rinninella, A.', 'Giorgio, E.', 'Pippucci, T.', 'Dimartino, P.', 'Rzasa, J.', 'Rooney, K.', 'McConkey, H.', 'Petlichkovski, A.', 'Pasini, B.', 'Sukarova-Angelovska, E.', 'Campbell, C.

However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization. Conclusion: The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.","['Kilanowski, A.', 'Merid, S.

Here we aim to determine whether differential DNAm mediates the association between PTE and PAE and neurodevelopment at 6 (N = 112) and 24 months (N = 184) in children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. PTE and PAE were assessed antenatally using urine cotinine measurements and the ASSIST questionnaire, respectively. Cord blood DNAm was measured using the EPIC and 450 K BeadChips. Neurodevelopment (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behavior, socioemotional) was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We constructed methylation risk scores (MRS) for PTE and PAE and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) with these MRS as mediators. Next, we conducted a high-dimensional mediation analysis to identify individual CpG sites as potential mediators, followed by a CMA to estimate the average causal mediation effects (ACME) and total effect (TE). PTE and PAE were associated with neurodevelopment at 6 but not at 24 months. PTE MRS reached a prediction accuracy (R2) of 0.23 but did not significantly mediate the association between PTE and neurodevelopment. PAE MRS was not predictive of PAE (R2 = 0.006). For PTE, 31 CpG sites and eight CpG sites were identified as significant mediators (ACME and TE P < 0.05) for the cognitive and motor domains at 6 months, respectively. For PAE, 16 CpG sites and 1 CpG site were significant mediators for the motor and adaptive behavior domains at 6 months, respectively. Several of the associated genes, including MAD1L1, CAMTA1, and ALDH1A2 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting that differential DNAm may partly explain the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTE and PAE and child neurodevelopment.

DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for neurodevelopment that is altered in schizophrenia, is a key molecular system of interest. METHODS: In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm in cord blood with LVV in childhood (measured using T1-weighted brain scans at 10 years), based on data from a large population-based birth cohort, the Generation R Study (N = 840). Employing both probe-level and methylation profile score (MPS) approaches, we further examined whether epigenetic modifications identified at birth in cord blood are: (a) also observed cross-sectionally in childhood using peripheral blood DNAm at age of 10 years (Generation R, N = 370) and (b) prospectively associated with LVV measured in young adulthood in an all-male sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 114). RESULTS: At birth, DNAm levels at four CpGs (annotated to potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, KCTD3; SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator, SDCCAG8; glutaredoxin, GLRX) prospectively associated with childhood LVV after genome-wide correction; these genes have been implicated in brain development and psychiatric traits including schizophrenia. An MPS capturing a broader epigenetic profile of LVV - but not individual top hits - showed significant cross-sectional associations with LVV in childhood in Generation R and prospectively associated with LVV in early adulthood within ALSPAC. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds suggestive evidence that DNAm at birth prospectively associates with LVV at different life stages, albeit with small effect sizes. The prediction of MPS on LVV in a childhood sample and an independent male adult sample further underscores the stability and reproducibility of DNAm as a potential marker for LVV. Future studies with larger samples and comparable time points across development are needed to further elucidate how DNAm associates with this clinically relevant brain structure and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, and what factors explain the identified DNAm profile of LVV at birth.","['Luo, M.', 'Walton, E.', 'Neumann, A.', 'Thio, C.

It is caused by a variable size and breakpoint microdeletions in the distal long arm of chromosome 22, referred to as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, including the SHANK3 gene. Genetic defects in a growing number of neurodevelopmental genes have been shown to cause genome-wide disruptions in epigenomic profiles referred to as epi-signatures in affected individuals. Results: In this study we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 22 individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including 11 individuals with large (2 to 5.8 Mb) 22q13.3 deletions, 10 with small deletions (< 1 Mb) or intragenic variants in SHANK3 and one mosaic case. We describe a novel genome-wide DNA methylation epi-signature in a subset of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Conclusion: We identified the critical region including the BRD1 gene as responsible for the Phelan-McDermid syndrome epi-signature.

In this study, we characterized a distinct DNA methylation epigenetic signature (episignature) distinguishing WITKOS from unaffected individuals as well as individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders with episignatures and described 9 previously unpublished individuals with SIN3A haploinsufficiency. Methods: We studied the phenotypic characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the identification of the episignature and building of a predictive diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples. Results: A predominantly hypomethylated DNA methylation profile specific to WITKOS was identified, and the classifier model was able to diagnose a previously unresolved test case. The episignature was sensitive enough to detect individuals with varying degrees of phenotypic severity carrying SIN3A haploinsufficient variants.

Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort. METHODS: All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist. RESULTS: Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time. The MRSs have the potential to be a novel clinical biomarker for the assessment of trauma-related health risks. Copyright © 2022.

TET3 deficiency, or Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS; MIM: 618798), is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder of the DNA demethylation machinery with a nonspecific phenotype resembling other chromatin-modifying disorders, but inconsistent variant types and inheritance patterns pose diagnostic challenges. Given TET3’s direct role in regulating 5-methylcytosine and recent identification of syndrome-specific DNA methylation profiles, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood of TET3-deficient individuals and identified an episignature that distinguishes affected and unaffected individuals and those with mono-allelic and bi-allelic pathogenic variants. Validation and testing of the episignature correctly categorized known TET3 variants and determined pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. Clinical utility was demonstrated when the episignature alone identified an affected individual from over 1000 undiagnosed cases and was confirmed upon distinguishing TET3-deficient individuals from those with 46 other disorders. The TET3-deficient signature - and the signature resulting from activating mutations in DNMT1 which normally opposes TET3 - are characterized by hypermethylation, which for BEFAHRS involves CpG sites that may be biologically relevant. This work expands the role of epi-phenotyping in molecular diagnosis and reveals genome-wide DNA methylation profiling as a quantitative, functional readout for characterization of this new biochemical category of disease.","['Levy, M.

Lysine-demethylase 2B (KDM2B) encodes an epigenetic regulator and mouse models suggest an important role during development. We set out to determine whether KDM2B variants are associated with NDD. Methods: Through international collaborations, we collected data on individuals with heterozygous KDM2B variants. We applied methylation arrays on peripheral blood DNA samples to determine a KDM2B associated epigenetic signature. Results: We recruited a total of 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in KDM2B. We present evidence, including a shared epigenetic signature, to support a pathogenic classification of 15 KDM2B variants and identify the CxxC domain as a mutational hotspot. Both loss-of-function and CxxC-domain missense variants present with a specific subepisignature. Moreover, the KDM2B episignature was identified in the context of a dual molecular diagnosis in multiple individuals. Our efforts resulted in a cohort of 21 individuals with heterozygous (likely) pathogenic variants. Individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; congenital organ anomalies mainly of the heart, eyes, and urogenital system; and subtle facial dysmorphism. Conclusion: Pathogenic heterozygous variants in KDM2B are associated with NDD and a specific epigenetic signature detectable in peripheral blood.","['van Jaarsveld, R. H.', 'Reilly, J.', 'Cornips, M.

We aimed to explore relationship between prenatal exposures and adolescent's psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits mediated through epigenetic biomarkers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used data from mother-child dyads from pregnancy and adolescents at 16-17 years from two prospective cohorts: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) and Raine Study from Australia. Factor analysis was applied to generate two different latent factor structures: (a) prenatal exposures and (b) adolescence psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits. Furthermore, three types of epigenetic biomarkers were included: (1) DNA methylation score for maternal smoking during pregnancy (DNAmMSS), (2) DNAm age estimate PhenoAge and (3) DNAm estimate for telomere length (DNAmTL). Similar factor structure was observed between both cohorts yielding three prenatal factors, namely BMI (Body Mass Index), SOP (Socio-Obstetric-Profile), and Lifestyle, and four adolescent factors: Anthropometric, Insulin-Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, and Mental health. In the SEM pathways, stronger direct effects of F1prenatal-BMI (NFBC1986 = beta: 0.27; Raine = beta: 0.39) and F2prenatal-SOP (beta: -0.11) factors were observed on adolescent psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We observed an indirect effect of prenatal latent factors through epigenetic markers on a psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity factor in Raine study (P < 0.05). The present study exemplifies an evidence-based approach in two different birth cohorts to demonstrate similar composite structure of prenatal exposures and psycho-cardiometabolic traits (despite cultural, social, and genetic differences) and a common plausible pathway between them through underlying epigenetic markers.

Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations (“epivariants”) can drive disease by modulating gene expression at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can result in distinct “episignature” biomarkers for monogenic disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10 individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2 using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ~2% (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases.","['LaFlamme, C.

We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy.

We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes.

Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; beta = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020-0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood.

We recently reported an association between an epigenetic biomarker of early-life tobacco smoke exposure at the AHRR gene and increased frequency of somatic gene deletions among ALL cases. METHODS: Here, we further assess this association using two epigenetic biomarkers for maternal smoking during pregnancy-DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and a recently established polyepigenetic smoking score-in an expanded set of 482 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases in the California Childhood Leukemia Study with available Illumina 450K or MethylationEPIC array data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the associations between the epigenetic biomarkers and gene deletion numbers. RESULTS: We found an association between DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion number among 284 childhood B-ALL cases with MethylationEPIC array data, with a ratio of means (RM) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.69] for each 0.1 beta value reduction in DNA methylation, an effect size similar to our previous report in an independent set of 198 B-ALL cases with 450K array data [meta-analysis summary RM (sRM) = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57]. The polyepigenetic smoking score was positively associated with gene deletion frequency among all 482 B-ALL cases (sRM = 1.31 for each 4-unit increase in score; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57).

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

TRIP12 encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway. The ubiquitin pathway includes activating E1, conjugating E2 and ligating E3 enzymes which regulate the breakdown and sorting of proteins. This enzymatic pathway is crucial for physiological processes. A significant proportion of TRIP12 variants are currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Episignatures have been shown to represent a powerful diagnostic tool to resolve inconclusive genetic findings for Mendelian disorders and to re-classify VUSs. Here, we show the results of DNA methylation episignature analysis in 32 individuals with pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS variants in TRIP12. We identified a specific and sensitive DNA methylation (DNAm) episignature associated with pathogenic TRIP12 variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for Clark–Baraitser syndrome. In addition, we performed analysis of differentially methylated regions as well as functional correlation of the TRIP12 genome-wide methylation profile with the profiles of 56 additional neurodevelopmental disorders.","['van der Laan, L.', 'Rooney, K.', 'Alders, M.', 'Relator, R.', 'McConkey, H.', 'Kerkhof, J.', 'Levy, M.

However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.

As microarray platforms continue to evolve and increase the scope of CpGs measured, new discoveries based on the most recent platform version and how they compare to available data from the previous versions of the platform are unknown. The neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI 850) is a blood-based DNA methylation biomarker built on the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array that measures epigenetic responses to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid often administered for inflammation. Here, we compare the NDMI 850 to one we built using data from the Illumina Methylation 450K (NDMI 450). RESULTS: The NDMI 450 consisted of 22 loci, 15 of which were present on the NDMI 850. In adult whole blood samples, the linear composite scores from NDMI 450 and NDMI 850 were highly correlated and had equivalent predictive accuracy for detecting DEX exposure among adult glioma patients and non-glioma adult controls. However, the NDMI 450 scores of newborn cord blood were significantly lower than NDMI 850 in samples measured with both assays. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an algorithm that reproduces the DNA methylation glucocorticoid response score using 450K data, increasing the accessibility for researchers to assess this biomarker in archived or publicly available datasets that use the 450K version of the Illumina BeadChip array. However, the NDMI850 and NDMI450 do not give similar results in cord blood, and due to data availability limitations, results from sample types of newborn cord blood should be interpreted with care.

We hypothesized that the disruption of chromatin regulation might result in specific DNA methylation patterns that could be used in the molecular diagnosis of ADNP syndrome. RESULTS: We identified two distinct and partially opposing genomic DNA methylation episignatures in the peripheral blood samples from 22 patients with ADNP syndrome. The ""epi-ADNP-1"" episignature included ~ 6000 mostly hypomethylated CpGs, and the ""epi-ADNP-2"" episignature included ~ 1000 predominantly hypermethylated CpGs. The two signatures correlated with the locations of the ADNP mutations. Epi-ADNP-1 mutations occupy the N- and C-terminus, and epi-ADNP-2 mutations are centered on the nuclear localization signal. The episignatures were enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function. A classifier trained on these profiles yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with either of the two episignatures. Applying this model to seven patients with uncertain clinical diagnosis enabled reclassification of genetic variants of uncertain significance and assigned new diagnosis when the primary clinical suspicion was not correct. When applied to a large cohort of unresolved patients with developmental delay (N = 1150), the model predicted three additional previously undiagnosed patients to have ADNP syndrome. DNA sequencing of these subjects, wherever available, identified pathogenic mutations within the gene domains predicted by the model. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first Mendelian condition with two distinct episignatures caused by mutations in a single gene. These highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignatures enable diagnosis, screening, and genetic variant classifications in ADNP syndrome.","['Bend, E. G.', 'Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Everman, D.

The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).

This interaction is thought to occur through epigenetic mechanisms, inducing differential gene expression, thereby moderating neuronal cell and circuit function, and thus shaping aggressive behaviour. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels were measured in peripheral blood obtained from 95 individuals participating in the Estonian Children Personality Behaviours and Health Study (ECPBHS) at 15 and 25 years of age. We examined the association between aggressive behaviour, as measured by Life History of Aggression (LHA) total score and DNAm levels both assessed at age 25. We further examined the pleiotropic effect of genetic variants regulating LHA-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and multiple traits related to aggressive behaviours. Lastly, we tested whether the DNA methylomic loci identified in association with LHA at age 25 were also present at age 15. RESULTS: We found one differentially methylated position (DMP) (cg17815886; p = 1.12 x 10-8 ) and five differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LHA after multiple testing adjustments. The DMP annotated to the PDLIM5 gene, and DMRs resided in the vicinity of four protein-encoding genes (TRIM10, GTF2H4, SLC45A4, B3GALT4) and a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC02068). We observed evidence for the colocalization of genetic variants associated with top DMPs and general cognitive function, educational attainment and cholesterol levels. Notably, a subset of the DMPs associated with LHA at age 25 also displayed altered DNAm patterns at age 15 with high accuracy in predicting aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential role of DNAm in the development of aggressive behaviours. We observed pleiotropic genetic variants associated with identified DMPs, and various traits previously established to be relevant in shaping aggression in humans. The concordance of DNAm signatures in adolescents and young adults may have predictive value for inappropriate and maladaptive aggression later in life. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on patients with PURA variants, we aim to establish a PURA-NDD-specific methylation profile and provide further insights on the molecular basis of the PURA-NDD. METHODS: Twenty three individuals (including 12 unpublished) carrying PURA variants were enrolled. We conducted the Illumina Infinium EPIC microarray analysis in 17 PURA-NDD individuals. In vitro experiments were performed to examine how PURA variants affect Pur-a expression. RESULTS: Additional phenotypes in 12 newly identified patients were described in this study. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis unveiled distinctive methylation profiles to PURA-NDD, and the established classifier can reclassify PURA variants of uncertain significance. Patients bearing PURA hapoloinsufficient and missense variants have comparable DNA methylation profiles, and cells expressing these PURA variants showed consistent Pur-a downregulation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism. CONCLUSION: Patients with PURA-NDD exhibit a specific episignature, which has potential to aid identification and diagnosis of PURA-NDD patients and offer implications for further functional investigations.

The mechanistic cross-talk between histone modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures, we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical and molecular features associated with the disruption of the epigenetic machinery.","['Aref-Eshghi, E.', 'Rodenhiser, D.

DNAm in specific sites can also predict newborn gestational age and gestational age acceleration (GAA). GAA occurs when the predicted biological age is higher than the chronological age. In adults, poor health outcomes related to this deviance are well documented and raise questions for the interpretation and prediction in early stages of life. Boys seem to be more vulnerable to intrauterine stress exposure than girls; however, the mechanisms of adaptive sex-specific responses are still unclear. We hypothesize that intrauterine stress exposure is associated with GAA and could be different in boys and girls if inflammatory or glucocorticoid pathways exposure is considered. RESULTS: Using the Western Region Birth Cohort (ROC-Sao Paulo, Brazil) (n = 83), we calculated DNAm age and GAA from cord blood samples. Two epigenetic risk scores were calculated as an indirect proxy for low-grade inflammation (i-ePGS) and for glucocorticoid exposure (GES). Multivariate linear regression models were applied to investigate associations of GAA with prenatal exposures. The i-ePGS and GES were included in different models with the same co-variates considering sex interactions. The first multivariate model investigating inflammatory exposure (adj. R2 = 0.31, p = < 0.001) showed that GAA was positively associated with i-ePGS (CI, 0.26-113.87, p = 0.049) and negative pregnancy-related feelings (CI, 0.04-0.48 p = 0.019). No sex interaction was observed. The second model investigating glucocorticoid exposure (adj. R2 = 0.32, p = < 0.001) showed that the higher was the GAA was associated with a lower the lower was the GES in girls (CI, 0.04-2.55, p = 0.044). In both models, maternal self-reported mental disorder was negatively associated with GAA. CONCLUSION: Prenatal epigenetic score of exposure to low-grade inflammatory was a predictor of GAA for both sexes. Glucocorticoid epigenetic score seems to be more important to GAA in girls. This study supports the evidence of sex-specificity in stress response, suggesting the glucocorticoid as a possible pathway adopted by girls to accelerate the maturation in an adverse condition.

This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] <= 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression >= 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.","['Provencal, N.', 'Arloth, J.', 'Cattaneo, A.', 'Anacker, C.', 'Cattane, N.', 'Wiechmann, T.', 'Roh, S.', 'Kodel, M.', 'Klengel, T.', 'Czamara, D.', 'Muller, N.

Because the 22q11.2 region harbours genes coding for transcriptional factors and chromatin remodelers, in this study, we performed analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of peripheral blood from 49 patients with 22q11.2DS using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip arrays. This cohort comprises 43 typical, 2 proximal and 4 distal deletions. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific episignature in all typical and proximal 22q11.2DS. The sensitivity and specificity of this signature was further confirmed by comparing it to over 1500 patients with other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. Mapping the 22q11.2DS DNA methylation episignature provides both novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and an effective tool in the molecular diagnosis of 22q11.2DS.","['Rooney, K.', 'Levy, M.

In this paper, preliminary data demonstrating a DNA methylation signature for Renpenning syndrome (RENS1 – OMIM 309500), which is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is reported.

It is caused by inactivating predominantly biallelic mutations involving >20 genes encoding proteins with roles in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Molecular diagnosis of FA is challenging due to the wide spectrum of the contributing gene mutations and structural rearrangements. The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.","['Pagliara, D.', 'Ciolfi, A.', 'Pedace, L.', 'Haghshenas, S.', 'Ferilli, M.', 'Levy, M.

DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00 to 4.71 , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 0.218 ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 0.371 ), independent of other confounding exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects.

Using genome-wide genotype and methylation data at birth from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n = 1456), a polygenic risk score (PRS), and newborn (nMRS) and childhood (cMRS) methylation risk scores, were developed to predict childhood asthma diagnosis. Each risk score was integrated with two previously published childhood asthma prediction models (CAPE and CAPP) and were validated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study. Individually, the genomic risk scores demonstrated modest-to-moderate discriminative performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC: PRS = 0.64, nMRS = 0.55, cMRS = 0.54), and their integration only marginally improved the performance of the CAPE (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.71) and CAPP models (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.82). The limited predictive performance of each genomic risk score individually and their inability to substantially improve upon the performance of the CAPE and CAPP models suggests that genetic and epigenetic predictors of the broad phenotype of asthma are unlikely to have clinical utility. Hence, further studies predicting specific asthma endotypes are warranted.","['Kothalawala, D. M.', 'Kadalayil, L.', 'Curtin, J. A.', 'Murray, C. S.', 'Simpson, A.', 'Custovic, A.', 'Tapper, W.

Pathogenic variation in epigenetic regulators can impair deposition of histone post-translational modifications leading to aberrant spatiotemporal gene expression during neurodevelopment. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a prominent multi-subunit epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is responsible for histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). Using exome sequencing, here we identify a cohort of 25 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants in MSL complex member MSL2. MSL2 variants were associated with NDD phenotypes including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and motor issues such as coordination problems, feeding difficulties, and gait disturbance. Dysmorphisms and behavioral and/or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and to a lesser extent, seizures, connective tissue disease signs, sleep disturbance, vision problems, and other organ anomalies, were observed in affected individuals. As a molecular biomarker, a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature has been established. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from three members of our cohort exhibited reduced MSL2 levels. Remarkably, while NDD-associated variants in two other members of the MSL complex (MOF and MSL3) result in reduced H4K16ac, global H4K16ac levels are unchanged in iPSCs with MSL2 variants. Regardless, MSL2 variants altered the expression of MSL2 targets in iPSCs and upon their differentiation to early germ layers. Our study defines an MSL2-related disorder as an NDD with distinguishable clinical features, a specific blood DNA episignature, and a distinct, MSL2-specific molecular etiology compared to other MSL complex-related disorders.","['Karayol, R.', 'Borroto, M.

Maternal smoking may induce such long-term effects through persistent changes in the DNA methylome, which therefore hold the potential to be used as a biomarker of this early life exposure. With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier (""Reese Score"") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.","['Rauschert, S.', 'Melton, P.

Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties. This is the first investigation of cord blood DNA methylation signs of fetal programming of PND on child behavior at 18 months of age and thus calls for independent replications. Copyright © 2022.

Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p < 5×10-5). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], p=5.5×10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8×10-9) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (p > 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (-0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (-0.043±0.013kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birthweight in newborns, in both white European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers.","['Deng, W.

Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F, and PPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.","['Lariviere, D.', 'Craig, S.

Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

Diagnosis relies on clinical history and measurements of allergen-specific IgE. We hypothesize that a multi-omics model could accurately diagnose childhood allergic disease. We show that nasal DNA methylation has the strongest predictive power to diagnose childhood allergy, surpassing blood DNA methylation, genetic risk scores, and environmental factors. DNA methylation at only three nasal CpG sites classifies allergic disease in Dutch children aged 16 years well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. This is replicated in Puerto Rican children aged 9-20 years (AUC 0.82). DNA methylation at these CpGs additionally detects allergic multimorbidity and symptomatic IgE sensitization. Using nasal single-cell RNA-sequencing data, these three CpGs associate with influx of T cells and macrophages that contribute to allergic inflammation.

High-throughput sequencing leads to an etiological diagnosis in up to 50% of individuals with heterogeneous neurodevelopmental or malformation disorders. There is a growing interest in additional omics technologies in translational research settings to examine the remaining unsolved cases. Methods: We gathered 30 individuals with malformation syndromes and/or severe neurodevelopmental disorders with negative trio exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization results through a multicenter project. We applied short-read genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation analysis, in that order, as complementary translational research tools for a molecular diagnosis. Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood. Conclusion: Overall, our integrated genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylation analysis solved 10/30 (33.3%) cases and identified a strong candidate gene in 4/30 (13.3%) of the patients with rare neurodevelopmental disorders and negative exome sequencing results.

Kdm5c is a histone lysine demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients. Results: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts with previously described epi-signatures. Conclusion: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C gene.","['Schenkel, L.

DNA methylation signatures can function as biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure. However, the robustness of DNA methylation signatures across child ages, genetic ancestry groups, or tissues is not clear. Using coefficients from a meta-analysis of prenatal smoke exposure and DNA methylation in newborn cord blood, we created polymethylation scores of saliva DNA methylation from children at ages 9 and 15 in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. In the full sample at age 9 (n = 753), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.51 (95%CI: 0.35, 0.66) standard deviation higher polymethylation score. The direction and magnitude of the association was consistent in European and African genetic ancestry samples. In the full sample at age 15 (n = 747), prenatal smoke exposure was associated with a 0.48 (95%CI: 0.32, 0.63) standard deviation higher polymethylation score, and the association was attenuated among the European and Admixed-Latin genetic ancestry samples. The polymethylation score classified prenatal smoke exposure accurately (AUC age 9 = 0.77, age 15 = 0.76).

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n = 749) and 15 (n = 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158, p = 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095, p = 0.06) across all participants. The PM10 findings were driven by the age 15 subset where an interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a -0.024 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.043, -0.005, p = 0.012). Findings were robust to adjustment for PM exposure at ages 1 and 3. In utero PM10-associated DNA methylation differences were identified at age 15 in saliva. Benchmarking the timing and cell-type generalizability is critical for epigenetic exposure biomarker assessment.","['Bakulski, K. M.', 'Fisher, J. D.', 'Dou, J.

New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences.","['Chen, J. Y.', 'Gatev, E.', 'Everson, T.', 'Conneely, K.

This condition is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous. Deletions involving two non-overlapping regions, known as the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are sufficient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorphisms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region. Here, we used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to define a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that overlap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. The clinical profile of this disease includes developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention deficit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrow palate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especially in females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co-expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsufficiency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affected females, providing further evidence of a specific contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome-specific episignature that classifies syndromic traits. We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric to the previously established 1p36 critical regions.

It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N = 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency.","['Tieskens, J.

Methylation profile scores (MPSs) index biological aging and aging-related disease in adults and are cross-sectionally associated with social determinants of health in childhood. MPSs thus provide an opportunity to trace how aging-related biology responds to environmental changes in early life. Information regarding the stability of MPSs in early life is currently lacking. Method. We use longitudinal data from children and adolescents ages 8-18 (N = 428, M age = 12.15 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Participants contributed two waves of salivary DNA-methylation data (mean lag = 3.94 years), which were used to construct four MPSs reflecting multi-system physiological decline and mortality risk (PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel), pace of biological aging (DunedinPACE), and cognitive function (Epigenetic-g). Furthermore, we exploit variation among participants in whether they were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic during the course of study participation, in order to test how a historical period characterized by environmental disruption might affect children’s aging-related MPSs. Results. All MPSs showed moderate longitudinal stability (test-retest rs = 0.42, 0.44, 0.46, 0.51 for PhenoAgeAccel, GrimAgeAccel, and Epigenetic-g, and DunedinPACE, respectively). No differences in the stability of MPSs were apparent between those whose second assessment took place after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic vs. those for whom both assessments took place prior to the pandemic. Conclusions. Aging-related DNA-methylation patterns are less stable in childhood than has been previously observed in adulthood. Further developmental research on the methylome is necessary to understand which environmental perturbations in childhood impact trajectories of biological aging and when children are most sensitive to those impacts.","['deSteiguer, A.

Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.","['Reed, Z. E.', 'Suderman, M. J.', 'Relton, C.

It is caused by pathogenic variants in the PHIP gene that encodes for the Pleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein, which is part of an epigenetic modifier protein complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHIP haploinsufficiency may impact genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the DNAm profiles of affected individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic PHIP variants with Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays and report a specific and sensitive DNAm episignature biomarker for Chung-Jansen syndrome. In addition, we observed similarities between the methylation profile of Chung-Jansen syndrome and that of functionally related and clinically partially overlapping genetic disorders, White-Kernohan syndrome (caused by variants in DDB1 gene) and Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (caused by variants in PHF6 gene). Based on these observations we also proceeded to develop a common episignature biomarker for these disorders. These newly defined episignatures can be used as part of a multiclass episignature classifier for screening of affected individuals with rare disorders and interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance, and provide further insights into the common molecular pathophysiology of the clinically-related Chung-Jansen, Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann and White-Kernohan syndromes.

Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype–phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26–28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.","['Dingemans, A.

Archival files from three pediatric institutions were queried for unusual cases of pediatric (<=21 years) CNS EWSR1-rearranged tumors confirmed by at least one molecular technique. Extra-axial tumors and cases with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1-ETS family fusions) were excluded. Additional studies, including anchored multiplex-PCR with next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, were performed as needed to determine fusion partner status and brain tumor methylation class, respectively. Five cases (median 17 years) were identified (M:F of 3:2). Location was parenchymal (n = 3) and undetermined (n = 2) with topographic distributions including posterior fossa (n = 1), frontal (n = 1), temporal (n = 1), parietal (n = 1) and occipital (n = 1) lobes. Final designation with fusion findings included desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWSR1-WT1; n = 1) and tumors of uncertain histogenesis (EWSR1-CREM, n = 1; EWSR1-CREB1, n = 1; EWSR1-PLAGL1, n = 1; and EWSR1-PATZ1, n = 1). Tumors showed a wide spectrum of morphology and biologic behavior. For EWSR1-CREM, EWSR1-PLAGL1 and EWSR1-PATZ1 tumors, no significant methylation scores were reached in the known brain tumor classes. Available outcome (4/5) was reported as favorable (n = 2) and unfavorable (n = 2) with a median follow-up of 30 months. In conclusion, we describe five primary EWSR1-non-ETS fused CNS tumors exhibiting morphologic and biologic heterogeneity and we highlight the clinical importance of determining specific fusion partners to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment and monitoring. Larger prospective clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of histotypes, anatomical location, fusion partners, breakpoints and methylation profiles in patients with these rare tumors.
