However, the biological mechanisms connecting PTE and PAE, DNAm, and neurodevelopment are largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether differential DNAm mediates the association between PTE and PAE and neurodevelopment at 6 (N = 112) and 24 months (N = 184) in children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. PTE and PAE were assessed antenatally using urine cotinine measurements and the ASSIST questionnaire, respectively. Cord blood DNAm was measured using the EPIC and 450 K BeadChips. Neurodevelopment (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behavior, socioemotional) was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We constructed methylation risk scores (MRS) for PTE and PAE and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) with these MRS as mediators. Next, we conducted a high-dimensional mediation analysis to identify individual CpG sites as potential mediators, followed by a CMA to estimate the average causal mediation effects (ACME) and total effect (TE). PTE and PAE were associated with neurodevelopment at 6 but not at 24 months. PTE MRS reached a prediction accuracy (R2) of 0.23 but did not significantly mediate the association between PTE and neurodevelopment. PAE MRS was not predictive of PAE (R2 = 0.006). For PTE, 31 CpG sites and eight CpG sites were identified as significant mediators (ACME and TE P < 0.05) for the cognitive and motor domains at 6 months, respectively. For PAE, 16 CpG sites and 1 CpG site were significant mediators for the motor and adaptive behavior domains at 6 months, respectively. Several of the associated genes, including MAD1L1, CAMTA1, and ALDH1A2 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting that differential DNAm may partly explain the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTE and PAE and child neurodevelopment.

Methods: Individuals with protein altering variants in SOX11 were identified through exome and genome sequencing and international data sharing. Deep clinical phenotyping was undertaken by referring clinicians. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC array. The expression pattern of SOX11 in developing human brain was defined using RNAscope. Results: We reported 38 new patients with SOX11 variants. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed as a feature of SOX11 syndrome. A distinctive pattern of blood DNA methylation was identified in SOX11 syndrome, separating SOX11 syndrome from other BAFopathies. Conclusion: SOX11 syndrome is a distinct clinical entity with characteristic clinical features and episignature differentiating it from BAFopathies.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2017526567&from=export,2022-11-01

DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming. Methods: Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings. Results: Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e−05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e−07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e−04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2021029713&from=export,2023-04-06

Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNA methylation defects at a single locus (epi-variants), while others can exhibit syndrome-specific DNA methylation changes across multiple loci (epi-signatures). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unresolved ND/CAs. We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model in resolving 67 individuals with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes.

This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases and highlights the potential value of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assessment of ND/CAs.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2001761137&from=export,2019-04-17

Here, we report a patient with features of Kabuki syndrome who carries two rare heterozygous variants in KMT2D: c.12935C>T, p.(Ser4312Phe) and c.15785-10T>G. The clinical significance of these variants were discordantly interpreted by different diagnostic laboratories. Parental testing showed that the missense variant was inherited from the father with a mild Kabuki phenotype and the intronic variant from the mother with mosaic status. Through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood, we confirmed that the proband exhibited a previously described episignature of Kabuki syndrome. Parental samples had normal DNA methylation profiles, thus ruling out the involvement of the paternally inherited missense variant. RNA analysis revealed that the intronic change resulted in exon 49 skipping and frameshift, thereby providing a molecular diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome. This study demonstrates the utility of epigenomic and RNA analyses in resolving ambiguous clinical cases. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/humu.23833,2019-10-13

Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes have identifiable patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) change: DNAm signatures or episignatures. Given the role of KANSL1 in histone acetylation, we tested whether variants underlying KdVS are associated with a DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 13 individuals with KANSL1 variants, four individuals with 17q21.31 microdeletions, and 21 typically developing individuals, using Illumina’s Infinium EPIC array. In this study, we identified a robust DNAm signature of 456 significant CpG sites in 8 individuals with KdVS, a pattern independently validated in an additional 7 individuals with KdVS. We also demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the signature and classify two KANSL1 VUS as well as four variants in individuals with atypical clinical presentation. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific DNAm changes in fibroblast cells from individuals with KdVS. Collectively, our findings contribute to the understanding of the epigenetic landscape related to KdVS and aid in the diagnosis and classification of variants in this structurally complex genomic region.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028142302&from=export,2024-01-31

Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n = 749) and 15 (n = 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 mug/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158, p = 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 mug/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095, p = 0.06) across all participants.

We examined prenatal and postnatal effects. For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects. The present study supports a link between i-ePGS and child and adolescent mental health.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0954579418000330,2018-08-13

RESULTS: We identified two distinct and partially opposing genomic DNA methylation episignatures in the peripheral blood samples from 22 patients with ADNP syndrome. The ""epi-ADNP-1"" episignature included ~ 6000 mostly hypomethylated CpGs, and the ""epi-ADNP-2"" episignature included ~ 1000 predominantly hypermethylated CpGs. The two signatures correlated with the locations of the ADNP mutations. Epi-ADNP-1 mutations occupy the N- and C-terminus, and epi-ADNP-2 mutations are centered on the nuclear localization signal.

It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error and bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalised linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2030784329&from=export,2024-03-25

It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Pathogenic variants in KMT2B have been associated with childhood-onset Dystonia-28 and Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 68 (MRD 68) for cases of neurodevelopmental impairment without dystonia (DYT28; OMIM 617284 and MRD68; OMIM 619934, respectively). Since its first description in 2016, approximately one hundred KMT2B genetic variants have been reported with heterogeneous phenotypes, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotypes. KMT2B-related disorders share many overlapping phenotypic characteristics with other neurodevelopmental disorders and delayed dystonia, that can appear later in childhood, often delaying clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, conventional genetic testing may not always provide actionable information (e.g., gene panel selection based on early clinical presentation or variants of uncertain significance), which prevents patients and families from obtaining early access to treatments and support. Herein, we describe the early diagnosis of KMT2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder by DNA methylation episignature testing in a 4-year-old patient without features of dystonia at diagnosis, which is reported to develop in more than 80% of KMT2B-related disorder cases. The proband, a 4-year-old female of Jewish-Israeli descent, presented with speech delay, microcephaly, poor weight gain, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, dysmorphism, intellectual disabilities and joint hyperlaxity, but presented no signs of dystonia at initial evaluation. Episignature screening in this pre-symptomatic patient enabled accurate genetic diagnosis and timely and actionable intervention earlier in the natural history of Childhood-onset Dystonia-28.

A Precise Clinical Description May Be Critical for Genetic Testing Approach and Final Diagnosis,"Pathogenic variants in genes are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation resulting in congenital anomalies, with most patients displaying a neurodevelopmental disorder and dysmorphism. Arboleda-Tham syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in KAT6A (Lysine Acetyltransferase 6A; OMIM 601408) has been recently described as a new neurodevelopmental disorder. Herein, we describe a patient characterized by complex phenotype subsequently diagnosed using the clinical exome sequencing (CES) with Arboleda-Tham syndrome (ARTHS; OMIM 616268). The analysis revealed the presence of de novo pathogenic variant in KAT6A gene, a nucleotide c.3385C>T substitution that introduces a premature termination codon (p.Arg1129*). The need for straight multidisciplinary collaboration and accurate clinical description findings (bowel obstruction/megacolon/intestinal malrotation) was emphasized, together with the utility of CES in establishing an etiological basis in clinical and genetical heterogeneous conditions. Therefore, considering the phenotypic characteristics, the condition's rarity and the reviewed literature, we propose additional diagnostic criteria that could help in the development of future clinical diagnostic guidelines. This was possible thanks to objective examinations performed during the long follow-up period, which permitted scrupulous registration of phenotypic changes over time to further assess this rare disorder. Finally, given that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns used for diagnostic testing and/or as biomarker of disease, a specific episignature for ARTHS has been identified.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes14010165,2023-01-07

To refine the phenotype and to better understand the molecular basis of the syndrome, we analyzed clinical data and performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a series of individuals carrying a YY1 variant. Methods: Clinical data were collected for 13 individuals not yet reported through an international call for collaboration. DNA was collected for 11 of these individuals and 2 previously reported individuals in an attempt to delineate a specific DNA methylation signature in GADEVS. Results: Phenotype in most individuals overlapped with the previously described features. We described 1 individual with atypical phenotype, heterozygous for a missense variant in a domain usually not involved in individuals with YY1 pathogenic missense variations. We also described a specific peripheral blood DNA methylation profile associated with YY1 variants. Conclusion: We reported a distinct DNA methylation episignature in GADEVS. We expanded the clinical profile of GADEVS to include thin/sparse hair and cryptorchidism. We also highlighted the utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for classification of variants of unknown clinical significance.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2016434811&from=export,2022-10-12

The first individuals ascertained carried de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in HNRNPK. Here, we report 32 individuals with AKS (26 previously unpublished), including 13 with de novo missense variants. We propose new clinical diagnostic criteria for AKS that differentiate it from the clinically overlapping Kabuki syndrome and describe a significant phenotypic expansion to include individuals with missense variants who present with subtle facial features and few or no malformations. Many gene-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures have been identified for neurodevelopmental syndromes. Because HNRNPK has roles in chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hypothesized that pathogenic variants in HNRNPK may be associated with a specific DNAm signature. Here, we report a unique DNAm signature for AKS due to LoF HNRNPK variants, distinct from controls and Kabuki syndrome. This DNAm signature is also identified in some individuals with de novo HNRNPK missense variants, confirming their pathogenicity and the phenotypic expansion of AKS to include more subtle phenotypes. Furthermore, we report that some individuals with missense variants have an “intermediate” DNAm signature that parallels their milder clinical presentation, suggesting the presence of an epi-genotype phenotype correlation. In summary, the AKS DNAm signature may help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of AKS. This DNAm signature also effectively supported clinical syndrome delineation and is a valuable aid for variant interpretation in individuals where a clinical diagnosis of AKS is unclear, particularly for mild presentations.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2020505805&from=export,2022-10-18

Heterozygous variants in lysine methyltransferase 2B (KMT2B), encoding a histone H3 methyltransferase, have been associated with a childhood-onset, progressive and complex form of dystonia (dystonia 28, DYT28). Since 2016, more than one hundred rare KMT2B variants have been reported, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense and other in-frame changes, many having an uncertain clinical impact. RESULTS: We characterize the genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of a cohort of 18 patients with pathogenic and unclassified KMT2B variants. We resolve the ""episignature"" associated with KMT2B haploinsufficiency, proving that this approach is robust in diagnosing clinically unsolved cases, properly classifying them with respect to other partially overlapping dystonic phenotypes, other rare neurodevelopmental disorders and healthy controls. Notably, defective KMT2B function in DYT28 causes a non-random DNA hypermethylation across the genome, selectively involving promoters and other regulatory regions positively controlling gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a distinctive DNA hypermethylation pattern associated with DYT28, provide an epigenetic signature for this disorder enabling accurate diagnosis and reclassification of ambiguous genetic findings and suggest potential therapeutic approaches.

WITKOS has variable expressivity that commonly overlaps with other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we characterized a distinct DNA methylation epigenetic signature (episignature) distinguishing WITKOS from unaffected individuals as well as individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders with episignatures and described 9 previously unpublished individuals with SIN3A haploinsufficiency. Methods: We studied the phenotypic characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the identification of the episignature and building of a predictive diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples. Results: A predominantly hypomethylated DNA methylation profile specific to WITKOS was identified, and the classifier model was able to diagnose a previously unresolved test case. The episignature was sensitive enough to detect individuals with varying degrees of phenotypic severity carrying SIN3A haploinsufficient variants. Conclusion: We identified a novel, robust episignature in WITKOS due to SIN3A haploinsufficiency. This episignature has the potential to aid identification and diagnosis of individuals with WITKOS.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2021269664&from=export,2023-03-27

Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood.

DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00 to 4.71 , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 0.218 ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 0.371 ), independent of other confounding exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hemizygous KDM5C pathogenic variants cause X-linked intellectual disability of Claes-Jensen type. Because of its mode of inheritance and the low specificity of the clinical phenotype, interpretation of variants can be difficult, hence the need for functional studies and biomarkers specific to this disorder. We present the case of a male patient with intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities and subtle dysmorphic features, in which genetic investigation identified a hemizygous novel missense KDM5C variant of uncertain significance (VUS), inherited from his asymptomatic mother and present in his paucisymptomatic sister. We assessed the global genomic DNA methylation status from a whole blood sample of the proband. Global DNA methylation profiling specifically identified the recently discovered epi-signature of Claes-Jensen syndrome. This result served as a biomarker which independently highlighted KDM5C as the cause of the disorder in this patient. Because of the X-linked mode of inheritance, variant reclassification had a high impact on genetic counseling in this family. This example highlights the value of global methylome profiling in situations of variants of uncertain significance in genes with a known specific epi-signature.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2019113262&from=export,2022-08-03

Here, we describe the first de novo intronic deletion, affecting the splice-acceptor site of the first coding ADNP exon in a five-year-old girl with developmental delay and autism. Whereas exome sequencing failed to detect the non-coding deletion, genome-wide CpG methylation analysis revealed an episignature suggestive of a Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome diagnosis. This diagnosis was further supported by PhenoScore, a novel facial recognition software package. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing resolved the three-base pair ADNP deletion c.[-5-1_-4del] with transcriptome sequencing showing this deletion leads to skipping of exon 4. An N-terminal truncated protein could not be detected in transfection experiments with a mutant expression vector in HEK293T cells, strongly suggesting this is a first confirmed diagnosis exclusively due to haploinsufficiency of the ADNP gene. Pathway analysis of the methylome indicated differentially methylated genes involved in brain development, the cytoskeleton, locomotion, behavior, and muscle development. Along the same line, transcriptome analysis identified most of the differentially expressed genes as upregulated, in line with the hypomethylated CpG episignature and confirmed the involvement of the cytoskeleton and muscle development pathways that are also affected in patient cell lines and animal models. In conclusion, this novel mutation for the first time demonstrates that Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome can be caused by a loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, our study elegantly illustrates the use of EpiSignatures, WGS and Phenoscore as novel complementary diagnostic tools in case a of negative WES result. Copyright © 2024.

Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p < 5×10-5). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], p=5.5×10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8×10-9) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (p > 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (-0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (-0.043±0.013kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth.

Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p < 5×10-5). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], p=5.5×10-33) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.93 [1.27, 2.58], p=7.8×10-9) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (p > 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with a smaller birth size (-0.37±0.12 cm, p=0.0023) in the South Asian cohort and a lower birth weight (-0.043±0.013kg, p=0.0011) in the combined cohorts.

Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype–phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26–28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2019388660&from=export,2022-10-20

However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N = up-to 6401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10-28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; beta = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020-0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood. These findings support a potential role of early-life inflammation in the aetiology of depression and psychosis and highlight inflammation as a potential target for treatment and prevention.

DNAm in specific sites can also predict newborn gestational age and gestational age acceleration (GAA). GAA occurs when the predicted biological age is higher than the chronological age. In adults, poor health outcomes related to this deviance are well documented and raise questions for the interpretation and prediction in early stages of life. Boys seem to be more vulnerable to intrauterine stress exposure than girls; however, the mechanisms of adaptive sex-specific responses are still unclear. We hypothesize that intrauterine stress exposure is associated with GAA and could be different in boys and girls if inflammatory or glucocorticoid pathways exposure is considered. RESULTS: Using the Western Region Birth Cohort (ROC-Sao Paulo, Brazil) (n = 83), we calculated DNAm age and GAA from cord blood samples. Two epigenetic risk scores were calculated as an indirect proxy for low-grade inflammation (i-ePGS) and for glucocorticoid exposure (GES). Multivariate linear regression models were applied to investigate associations of GAA with prenatal exposures. The i-ePGS and GES were included in different models with the same co-variates considering sex interactions. The first multivariate model investigating inflammatory exposure (adj. R2 = 0.31, p = < 0.001) showed that GAA was positively associated with i-ePGS (CI, 0.26-113.87, p = 0.049) and negative pregnancy-related feelings (CI, 0.04-0.48 p = 0.019). No sex interaction was observed. The second model investigating glucocorticoid exposure (adj.

In both models, maternal self-reported mental disorder was negatively associated with GAA. CONCLUSION: Prenatal epigenetic score of exposure to low-grade inflammatory was a predictor of GAA for both sexes. Glucocorticoid epigenetic score seems to be more important to GAA in girls. This study supports the evidence of sex-specificity in stress response, suggesting the glucocorticoid as a possible pathway adopted by girls to accelerate the maturation in an adverse condition.

http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031815",2022-10-31,Clinical Utility of a Unique Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Signature for KMT2A-Related Syndrome,"Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is a Mendelian syndromic intellectual disability (ID) condition associated with hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, and characteristic facies caused by pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene. Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rare KMT2A variants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature for KMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in the KMT2A gene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015557438&from=export,2022-10-31

Features may include hypoplastic nails, slow growth, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Most reported cases are due to ARID1B loss of function variants. We report a boy with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, aspiration, recurrent respiratory infections, slow growth, and hypotonia without a clinical diagnosis, where a previously unreported ARID1B missense variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. The pathogenicity of this variant was refined through combined methodologies including genome-wide methylation signature analysis (EpiSign), Machine Learning (ML) facial phenotyping, and LIRICAL. Trio exome sequencing and EpiSign were performed. ML facial phenotyping compared facial images using FaceMatch and GestaltMatcher to syndrome-specific libraries to prioritize the trio exome bioinformatic pipeline gene list output. Phenotype-driven variant prioritization was performed with LIRICAL. A de novo heterozygous missense variant, ARID1B p.(Tyr1268His), was reported as a variant of uncertain significance. The ACMG classification was refined to likely pathogenic by a supportive methylation signature, ML facial phenotyping, and prioritization through LIRICAL. The ARID1B genotype-phenotype has been expanded through an extended analysis of missense variation through genome-wide methylation signatures, ML facial phenotyping, and likelihood-ratio gene prioritization.

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models.

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models.

They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models’ predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2026333342&from=export,2024-01-18

Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has recently been adapted for clinical testing of patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In this paper, preliminary data demonstrating a DNA methylation signature for Renpenning syndrome (RENS1 – OMIM 309500), which is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is reported. The identified episignature was then utilized to construct a highly sensitive and specific binary classification model. Besides providing evidence for the existence of a DNA methylation episignature for Renpenning syndrome, this study increases the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to the disease. Moreover, the availability of more subjects in future may facilitate the establishment of an episignature that can be utilized for diagnosis in a clinical setting and for reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2021652081&from=export,2023-08-17

The intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked, syndromic, Armfield type (MRXSA) is caused by missense variants in FAM50A. Functional studies revealed the pathogenesis to be a spliceosomopathy that is characterized by atypical mRNA processing during development. In this study, we assessed the peripheral blood specimens in a cohort of individuals with MRXSA and detected a unique and highly specific DNA methylation episignature associated with this disorder. We used this episignature to construct a support vector machine model capable of sensitive and specific identification of individuals with pathogenic variants in FAM50A. This study contributes to the expanding number of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders with defined DNA methylation episignatures, provides an additional understanding of the associated molecular mechanisms, and further enhances our ability to diagnose patients with rare disorders.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031111,2021-01-23

VRJS is caused by deletions of chromosome 8q24.3 or pathogenic variants in the PUF60 gene. Recently, pathogenic PUF60 variants have been reported in some individuals with VRJS, contributing to the variability in the clinical presentation and severity of the condition. PUF60 encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and cellular growth. In this report, we describe a new case of VRJS with developmental delay, cardiac-, and renal abnormalities, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic PUF60 variant. Surprisingly, DNA methylation analysis revealed a pattern resembling the Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) episignature, suggesting a potential connection between PUF60 and CdLS-related genes. This case report further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of VRJS and supports further research to validate the interaction between VRJS and CdLS.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028062151&from=export,2024-04-30

The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).

Pathogenic variation in epigenetic regulators can impair deposition of histone post-translational modifications leading to aberrant spatiotemporal gene expression during neurodevelopment. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a prominent multi-subunit epigenetic regulator of gene expression and is responsible for histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). Using exome sequencing, here we identify a cohort of 25 individuals with heterozygous de novo variants in MSL complex member MSL2. MSL2 variants were associated with NDD phenotypes including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and motor issues such as coordination problems, feeding difficulties, and gait disturbance. Dysmorphisms and behavioral and/or psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and to a lesser extent, seizures, connective tissue disease signs, sleep disturbance, vision problems, and other organ anomalies, were observed in affected individuals. As a molecular biomarker, a sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature has been established. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from three members of our cohort exhibited reduced MSL2 levels. Remarkably, while NDD-associated variants in two other members of the MSL complex (MOF and MSL3) result in reduced H4K16ac, global H4K16ac levels are unchanged in iPSCs with MSL2 variants. Regardless, MSL2 variants altered the expression of MSL2 targets in iPSCs and upon their differentiation to early germ layers. Our study defines an MSL2-related disorder as an NDD with distinguishable clinical features, a specific blood DNA episignature, and a distinct, MSL2-specific molecular etiology compared to other MSL complex-related disorders.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2032775324&from=export,2024-06-18

Methods: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood of 16 individuals with clinical features and genetic findings consistent with IDD21. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip microarrays. The methylation levels were fitted in a multivariate linear regression model to identify the differentially methylated probes. A binary support vector machine classification model was constructed to differentiate IDD21 samples from controls. Results: We identified a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive episignature associated with CTCF variants. Six variants of uncertain significance were tested, of which 2 mapped to the IDD21 episignature and clustered alongside IDD21 cases in both heatmap and multidimensional scaling plots. Comparison of the genomic DNA methylation profile of IDD21 with that of 56 other neurodevelopmental disorders provided insights into the underlying molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. Conclusion: The robust and specific CTCF/IDD21 episignature expands the growing list of neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct DNA methylation profiles, which can be applied as supporting evidence in variant classification.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2029764927&from=export,2024-01-25

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

METHODS: The EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was reported. An international working group, representing distinct EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions, collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions, resulting in 18.7% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.

Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

Associations between individual DNAm at CpGs and allergic diseases have been reported, but their joint predictive capability is unknown. METHODS: Data were obtained from 240 children of the German LISA cohort. DNAm was measured in blood clots at 6 (N = 234) and 10 years (N = 227) using the Illumina EPIC chip. Presence of aeroallergen sensitization was measured in blood at 6, 10, and 15 years. We calculated six methylation risk scores (MRS) for allergy-related phenotypes, like total and specific IgE, asthma, or any allergies, based on available publications and assessed their performances both cross-sectionally (biomarker) and prospectively (predictor of the disease). Dose-response associations between aeroallergen sensitization and MRS were evaluated. RESULTS: All six allergy-related MRS were highly correlated (r > .86), and seven CpGs were included in more than one MRS. Cross-sectionally, we observed an 81% increased risk for aeroallergen sensitization at 6 years with an increased MRS by one standard deviation (best-performing MRS, 95% confidence interval = [43%; 227%]). Significant associations were also seen cross-sectionally at 10 years and prospectively, though the effect of the latter was attenuated when restricted to participants not sensitized at baseline. A clear dose-response relationship with levels of aeroallergen sensitization could be established cross-sectionally, but not prospectively. CONCLUSION: We found good classification and prediction capabilities of calculated allergy-related MRS cross-sectionally, underlining the relevance of altered gene-regulation in allergic diseases and providing insights into potential DNAm biomarkers of aeroallergen sensitization.

However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization. Conclusion: The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2019126177&from=export,2022-09-28

However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses. Methods: Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6–10 years: N = 234; 10–15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort. Results: Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7–49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization.

Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations (“epivariants”) can drive disease by modulating gene expression at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can result in distinct “episignature” biomarkers for monogenic disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10 individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2 using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ~2% (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028194470&from=export,2023-11-28

However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). OBJECTIVES: We aim to fill this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation cohort. METHODS: Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear regressions, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, whose functions involve regulation of bone development (beta = -0.0036, per 1 point increase in the score; P = 5.6 x 10-8). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell signaling gene LUZP1 (beta = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 x 10-8). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Parental dietary quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of parental nutritional programming is warranted. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TET3 deficiency, or Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS; MIM: 618798), is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder of the DNA demethylation machinery with a nonspecific phenotype resembling other chromatin-modifying disorders, but inconsistent variant types and inheritance patterns pose diagnostic challenges. Given TET3’s direct role in regulating 5-methylcytosine and recent identification of syndrome-specific DNA methylation profiles, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood of TET3-deficient individuals and identified an episignature that distinguishes affected and unaffected individuals and those with mono-allelic and bi-allelic pathogenic variants. Validation and testing of the episignature correctly categorized known TET3 variants and determined pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance. Clinical utility was demonstrated when the episignature alone identified an affected individual from over 1000 undiagnosed cases and was confirmed upon distinguishing TET3-deficient individuals from those with 46 other disorders. The TET3-deficient signature - and the signature resulting from activating mutations in DNMT1 which normally opposes TET3 - are characterized by hypermethylation, which for BEFAHRS involves CpG sites that may be biologically relevant. This work expands the role of epi-phenotyping in molecular diagnosis and reveals genome-wide DNA methylation profiling as a quantitative, functional readout for characterization of this new biochemical category of disease.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2014144600&from=export,2022-02-28

Despite their distinct clinical presentations, we propose that ASXL1 mutations drive common epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in BOS and AML. We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA-seq data from BOS patients (n=13) and controls (n=38) and publicly available DNAm of AML cases with (n=3) and without (n=3) ASXL1 mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and RNA-seq data from AML cases (n=27) from the Beat AML cohort. Using a DNA-methylation based episignature that we previously developed for BOS, we clustered AML, BOS and normal controls together. We showed that AML samples with ASXL1 mutations clustered closest to individuals with BOS, whereas individuals with AML without ASXL1 mutations clustered separately. We also observe common dysregulation of the transcriptome between BOS and AML with ASXL1 mutations compared to controls. Our transcriptomic analysis identified 821 significantly differentially expressed genes that were shared between both data sets and 74.9% showed differential expression in the same direction. BOS patients are rare and have some reports of tumors but no clear guidelines on cancer screening protocols. This represents the first direct comparison between distinct diseases that show common epigenetic and transcriptomic effects, and potentially common drug targets for patients harboring ASXL1 mutations on the epigenome and transcriptome.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2022245515&from=export,2023-06-12

Archival files from three pediatric institutions were queried for unusual cases of pediatric (<=21 years) CNS EWSR1-rearranged tumors confirmed by at least one molecular technique. Extra-axial tumors and cases with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1-ETS family fusions) were excluded. Additional studies, including anchored multiplex-PCR with next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, were performed as needed to determine fusion partner status and brain tumor methylation class, respectively. Five cases (median 17 years) were identified (M:F of 3:2). Location was parenchymal (n = 3) and undetermined (n = 2) with topographic distributions including posterior fossa (n = 1), frontal (n = 1), temporal (n = 1), parietal (n = 1) and occipital (n = 1) lobes. Final designation with fusion findings included desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWSR1-WT1; n = 1) and tumors of uncertain histogenesis (EWSR1-CREM, n = 1; EWSR1-CREB1, n = 1; EWSR1-PLAGL1, n = 1; and EWSR1-PATZ1, n = 1). Tumors showed a wide spectrum of morphology and biologic behavior. For EWSR1-CREM, EWSR1-PLAGL1 and EWSR1-PATZ1 tumors, no significant methylation scores were reached in the known brain tumor classes. Available outcome (4/5) was reported as favorable (n = 2) and unfavorable (n = 2) with a median follow-up of 30 months. In conclusion, we describe five primary EWSR1-non-ETS fused CNS tumors exhibiting morphologic and biologic heterogeneity and we highlight the clinical importance of determining specific fusion partners to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment and monitoring. Larger prospective clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of histotypes, anatomical location, fusion partners, breakpoints and methylation profiles in patients with these rare tumors.

These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels.

In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM.

Clinical features of WHS include distinct dysmorphic facial features, growth restriction, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other malformations. The NSD2 gene localizes within this critical region along with several other genes. Pathogenic variants in NSD2 cause Rauch-Steindl (RAUST) syndrome. Clinical features of RAUST syndrome partially overlap with WHS, however epilepsy and the recognizable facial gestalt are not observed. Here, we report a case of a young boy who presented with developmental delay, dysmorphic features and short stature. After negative chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing, genomic DNA methylation episignature analysis was performed. Episignatures are sensitive and specific genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with a growing number of rare disorders. The patient was positive for the WHS episignature. Reanalysis of the patient's exome data identified a previously undetected frameshift variant in NSD2, leading to a diagnosis of RAUST. This report demonstrates the clinical utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for unresolved patients, and provides insight into the overlapping pathology between WHS and RAUST as demonstrated by the similarities in their genomic DNA methylation profiles.

Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is overrepresented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. RESULTS: In total, 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis.

This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13 , Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 8.3 x 10-3). In a preterm subgroup (n = 217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period. Copyright © 2024.

However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them. METHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score > 0.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (< 40), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (> 40), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated. Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age < 40 and lack of TERT promoter mutation. CONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients' risk.

Molecular techniques are instrumental for the categorization and differential diagnosis of these tumors. A subgroup of recently identified soft tissue sarcomas with undifferentiated round cell morphology was characterized by Capicua transcriptional receptor (CIC) rearrangements. Recently, an array‐based DNA methylation analysis of undifferentiated tumors with small blue round cell histology was shown to provide a highly robust and reproducible approach for precisely classifying this diagnostically challenging group of tumors. We describe the case of an undifferentiated sarcoma of the abdominal wall in a 12‐year‐old girl. The patient presented with a voluminous mass of the abdominal wall, and multiple micro‐nodules in the right lung. The tumor was unclassifiable with current immunohistochemical and molecular approaches. However, DNA methylation profiling allowed us to classify this neoplasia as small blue round cell tumor with CIC alterations. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. After 22 months, the patient is disease‐free and in good clinical condition. To put our experience in context, we conducted a literature review, analyzing current knowledge and state‐of‐the‐art diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of CIC rearranged sarcomas. Our findings further support the use of DNA methylation profiling as an important tool to improve diagnosis of non‐Ewing small round cell tumors.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2003961217&from=export,2020-04-29

Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites, which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1× log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (P = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance - thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity.

Pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the chromatin modifiers KMT2D and KDM6A are responsible for Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) and Kabuki syndrome 2 (KS2), respectively. In addition, 11 cases of KS1 caused by mosaic variants in KMT2D have been reported in the literature. Some of these individuals display milder craniofacial and growth phenotypes, and most do not have congenital heart defects. We report the case of an infant with severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral atresia and aortic atresia (HLHS MA-AA), pulmonary vein stenosis, and atypical facies with a somatic mosaic de novo nonsense variant in KMT2D (c.8200C>T, p.R2734*) identified on trio exome sequencing of peripheral blood and present in 11.2% of sequencing reads. KS was confirmed with EpiSign, a diagnostic genome-wide DNA methylation platform used to identify epigenetic signatures. This case suggests that use of this newly available clinical test can guide the interpretation of low-level mosaic variants identified through sequencing and suggests a new lower limit of mosaicism in whole blood required for a diagnosis of KS.

Novel therapies controlling the disorder prior to HSCT are needed. We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and antileukemic activity of azacitidine monotherapy prior to HSCT in newly diagnosed JMML patients. Eighteen patients enrolled from September 2015 to November 2017 were treated with azacitidine (75 mg/m2) administered IV once daily on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was the number of patients with clinical complete remission (cCR) or clinical partial remission (cPR) after 3 cycles of therapy. Pharmacokinetics, genome-wide DNA-methylation levels, and variant allele frequencies of leukemia-specific index mutations were also analyzed. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles and 5 patients completed 6 cycles. After 3 cycles, 11 patients (61%) were in cPR and 7 (39%) had progressive disease. Six of 16 patients (38%) who needed platelet transfusions were transfusion-free after 3 cycles. All 7 patients with intermediate- or low-methylation signatures in genome-wide DNA-methylation studies achieved cPR. Seventeen patients received HSCT; 14 (82%) were leukemia-free at a median follow-up of 23.8 months (range, 7.0-39.3 months) after HSCT. Azacitidine was well tolerated and plasma concentration-time profiles were similar to observed profiles in adults. In conclusion, azacitidine monotherapy is a suitable option for children with newly diagnosed JMML. Although long-term safety and efficacy remain to be fully elucidated in this population, these data demonstrate that azacitidine provides valuable clinical benefit to JMML patients prior to HSCT.

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages. This study illustrates the value of combining polygenic scores with information from methylation data for complex traits and exposure prediction.

MS may be seen as the epigenetic equivalent of PGS, but because of their dynamic nature and sensitivity of non-genetic exposures may add to complex trait prediction independently of PGS. MS and PGS were calculated based on genotype data and DNA-methylation data in blood samples from adults (Illumina 450 K; N = 2,431; mean age 35.6) and in buccal samples from children (Illumina EPIC; N = 1,128; mean age 9.6) from the Netherlands Twin Register. Weights to construct the scores were obtained from results of large epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) based on whole blood or cord blood methylation data and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In adults, MSs in blood predicted independently from PGSs, and outperformed PGSs for BMI, prenatal maternal smoking, and smoking status, but not for birth weight. The largest amount of variance explained by the multi-omics prediction model was for current vs. never smoking (54.6%) of which 54.4% was captured by the MS. The two predictors captured 16% of former vs. never smoking initiation variance (MS:15.5%, PGS: 0.5%), 17.7% of prenatal maternal smoking variance (MS:16.9%, PGS: 0.8%), 11.9% of BMI variance (MS: 6.4%, PGS 5.5%), and 1.9% of birth weight variance (MS: 0.4%, PGS: 1.5%). In children, MSs in buccal samples did not show independent predictive value. The largest amount of variance explained by the two predictors was for prenatal maternal smoking (2.6%), where the MSs contributed 1.5%. These results demonstrate that blood DNA MS in adults explain substantial variance in current smoking, large variance in former smoking, prenatal smoking, and BMI, but not in birth weight. Buccal cell DNA methylation scores have lower predictive value, which could be due to different tissues in the EWAS discovery studies and target sample, as well as to different ages.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-023-01406-9",2023-09-12,Episignature analysis of moderate effects and mosaics,"DNA methylation classifiers (“episignatures”) help to determine the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-023-01406-9",2023-09-12,Episignature analysis of moderate effects and mosaics,"DNA methylation classifiers (“episignatures”) help to determine the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.09.014",2023-12-18,Identification of a robust DNA methylation signature for Fanconi anemia,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous cancer-predisposing disorder representing the most common bone marrow failure syndrome. It is caused by inactivating predominantly biallelic mutations involving >20 genes encoding proteins with roles in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Molecular diagnosis of FA is challenging due to the wide spectrum of the contributing gene mutations and structural rearrangements. The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028074916&from=export,2023-12-18

This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] <= 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression >= 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820842116,2020-09-22

This condition is molecularly and clinically heterogeneous. Deletions involving two non-overlapping regions, known as the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are sufficient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorphisms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region. Here, we used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to define a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that overlap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. The clinical profile of this disease includes developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention deficit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrow palate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especially in females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co-expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsufficiency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affected females, providing further evidence of a specific contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome-specific episignature that classifies syndromic traits. We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric to the previously established 1p36 critical regions.

We examined the hypothesis that salivary DNA-methylation patterns of pace of biological aging (Dunedin pace of biological aging [DunedinPoAm]) and inflammation (DNA-methylation C-reactive protein [DNAm-CRP]) are socially stratified and associated with mental health in 1,183 children (609 female; age: M = 13.6 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Analyses were preregistered. Participants' DNA-methylation algorithms and psychiatric symptoms differed by socioeconomic contexts and race/ethnicity. Children with more parent-reported internalizing symptoms had higher DunedinPoAm and DNAm-CRP scores, and children with more aggression problems had higher DNAm-CRP. DunedinPoAm partially mediated advantage of White racial identity on internalizing. Likewise, DNAm-CRP partially mediated advantage of higher family socioeconomic contexts and, in a separate model, White racial identity on reduced internalizing symptoms. Children's epigenetic measures of pace of biological aging and inflammation are associated with social inequalities and mental health.",,2023-08-13

With declining costs for measuring DNA methylation, we aimed to develop a DNA methylation score that can be used on adolescent DNA methylation data and thereby generate a score for in utero cigarette smoke exposure. METHODS: We used machine learning methods to create a score reflecting exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This score is based on peripheral blood measurements of DNA methylation (Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). The score was developed and tested in the Raine Study with data from 995 white 17-y-old participants using 10-fold cross-validation. The score was further tested and validated in independent data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) (16-y-olds) and 1966 (NFBC1966) (31-y-olds). Further, three previously proposed DNA methylation scores were applied for comparison. The final score was developed with 204 CpGs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values for the best performing previously developed classifier (""Reese Score"") were 88% and 72% for Raine, 87% and 61% for NFBC1986 and 72% and 70% for NFBC1966, respectively; corresponding figures using the elastic net regression approach were 91% and 76% (Raine), 87% and 75% (NFBC1986), and 72% and 78% for NFBC1966. CONCLUSION: We have developed a DNA methylation score for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, outperforming the three previously developed scores. One possible application of the current score could be for model adjustment purposes or to assess its association with distal health outcomes where part of the effect can be attributed to maternal smoking. Further, it may provide a biomarker for fetal exposure to maternal smoking. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6076.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp6076,2020-09-13

Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. METHODS: Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17 years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7 years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. CONCLUSION: The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor.

Pregnant women disproportionately underreport smoking and smokers tend to have lower follow-up rates to repeat questionnaires. Missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data on presence and duration of smoking in pregnancy impairs identification of novel health effects and limits adjustment for smoking in studies of other pregnancy exposures. An objective biomarker in newborns of maternal smoking during pregnancy would be valuable. OBJECTIVES: We developed a biomarker of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy using common DNA methylation platforms. METHODS: Using a dimension reduction method, we developed and tested a numeric score in newborns to reflect sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy from data on cotinine, a short-term smoking biomarker measured mid-pregnancy, and Illumina450K cord blood DNA methylation from newborns in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). RESULTS: This score reliably predicted smoking status in the training set (n = 1,057; accuracy = 96%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 98%). Sensitivity (58%) was predictably lower in the much smaller test set (n = 221), but accuracy (91%) and specificity (97%) remained high. Reduced birth weight, a well-known effect of maternal smoking, was as strongly related to the score as to cotinine. A three-site score had lower, but acceptable, performance (accuracytrain = 82%, accuracytest = 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Our smoking methylation score represents a promising novel biomarker of sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy easily calculated with Illumina450K or IlluminaEPIC data. It may help identify novel health impacts and improve adjustment for smoking when studying other risk factors with more subtle effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp333,2017-04-13

The clinical presentation of the typical deletion includes: Velocardiofacial, Di George, Opitz G/BBB and Conotruncalanomaly face syndromes. Atypical deletions (proximal, distal or nested) are rare and characterized mainly by normal phenotype or mild intellectual disability and variable clinical features. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this disorder are not completely understood. Because the 22q11.2 region harbours genes coding for transcriptional factors and chromatin remodelers, in this study, we performed analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of peripheral blood from 49 patients with 22q11.2DS using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip arrays. This cohort comprises 43 typical, 2 proximal and 4 distal deletions. We demonstrated the evidence of a unique and highly specific episignature in all typical and proximal 22q11.2DS. The sensitivity and specificity of this signature was further confirmed by comparing it to over 1500 patients with other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. Mapping the 22q11.2DS DNA methylation episignature provides both novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and an effective tool in the molecular diagnosis of 22q11.2DS.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168611,2021-08-10

http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.c.32089",2024-06-21,Blepharophimosis with intellectual disability and Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome share episignature and phenotype,"Blepharophimosis with intellectual disability (BIS) is a recently recognized disorder distinct from Nicolaides-Baraister syndrome that presents with distinct facial features of blepharophimosis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. BIS is caused by pathogenic variants in SMARCA2, that encodes the catalytic subunit of the superfamily II helicase group of the BRG1 and BRM-associated factors (BAF) forming the BAF complex, a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcriptional regulation. Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype-specific episignature. A distinct episignature was shared by 15 individuals with BIS-causing SMARCA2 pathogenic variants and 12 individuals with class II HVDAS caused by truncating pathogenic ADNP variants. This represents first evidence of a sensitive phenotype-specific episignature biomarker shared across distinct genetic conditions that also exhibit unique gene-specific episignatures.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2030235620&from=export,2024-06-21

It is caused by a variable size and breakpoint microdeletions in the distal long arm of chromosome 22, referred to as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, including the SHANK3 gene. Genetic defects in a growing number of neurodevelopmental genes have been shown to cause genome-wide disruptions in epigenomic profiles referred to as epi-signatures in affected individuals. Results: In this study we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 22 individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including 11 individuals with large (2 to 5.8 Mb) 22q13.3 deletions, 10 with small deletions (< 1 Mb) or intragenic variants in SHANK3 and one mosaic case. We describe a novel genome-wide DNA methylation epi-signature in a subset of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Conclusion: We identified the critical region including the BRD1 gene as responsible for the Phelan-McDermid syndrome epi-signature. Metabolomic profiles of individuals with the DNA methylation epi-signature showed significantly different metabolomic profiles indicating evidence of two molecularly and phenotypically distinct clinical subtypes of Phelan-McDermid syndrome.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2010123271&from=export,2021-01-19

Kdm5c is a histone lysine demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients. Results: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts with previously described epi-signatures. Conclusion: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C gene.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L620674767&from=export,2018-02-28

Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort. METHODS: All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist. RESULTS: Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative of in utero exposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (n = 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (n = 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (n = 583). RESULTS: The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, p = 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized beta = -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, p = 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, p < 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs. METHODS: To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs. RESULTS: No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 x 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD. Copyright © 2022.

Methods: Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified. Results: Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data. Conclusion: Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis.

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time.

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time.

HAFOUS is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, behavioral abnormalities, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, hypogonadism, and mild dysmorphic features. We investigated the phenotype of 18 participants with HAFOUS and performed DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis, aiming to generate a diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, we performed comparative analysis with known episignatures to gain more insight into the molecular pathophysiology of HAFOUS. Methods: We assessed genomic DNAm profiles of 18 individuals with pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in USP7 to map and validate a specific episignature. The comparison between the USP7 cohort and 56 rare genetic disorders with earlier reported DNAm episignatures was performed with statistical and functional correlation. Results: We mapped a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature for pathogenic variants in USP7 and utilized this to reclassify the VUS. Comparative epigenomic analysis showed evidence of HAFOUS similarity to a number of other rare genetic episignature disorders. Conclusion: We discovered a sensitive and specific DNAm episignature as a robust diagnostic biomarker for HAFOUS that enables VUS reclassification in USP7. We also expand the phenotypic spectrum of 9 new and 5 previously reported individuals with HAFOUS.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2029917900&from=export,2024-02-07

TRIP12 encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway. The ubiquitin pathway includes activating E1, conjugating E2 and ligating E3 enzymes which regulate the breakdown and sorting of proteins. This enzymatic pathway is crucial for physiological processes. A significant proportion of TRIP12 variants are currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Episignatures have been shown to represent a powerful diagnostic tool to resolve inconclusive genetic findings for Mendelian disorders and to re-classify VUSs. Here, we show the results of DNA methylation episignature analysis in 32 individuals with pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS variants in TRIP12. We identified a specific and sensitive DNA methylation (DNAm) episignature associated with pathogenic TRIP12 variants, establishing its utility as a clinical biomarker for Clark–Baraitser syndrome. In addition, we performed analysis of differentially methylated regions as well as functional correlation of the TRIP12 genome-wide methylation profile with the profiles of 56 additional neurodevelopmental disorders.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2020282777&from=export,2023-04-19

Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on patients with PURA variants, we aim to establish a PURA-NDD-specific methylation profile and provide further insights on the molecular basis of the PURA-NDD. METHODS: Twenty three individuals (including 12 unpublished) carrying PURA variants were enrolled. We conducted the Illumina Infinium EPIC microarray analysis in 17 PURA-NDD individuals. In vitro experiments were performed to examine how PURA variants affect Pur-a expression. RESULTS: Additional phenotypes in 12 newly identified patients were described in this study. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis unveiled distinctive methylation profiles to PURA-NDD, and the established classifier can reclassify PURA variants of uncertain significance. Patients bearing PURA hapoloinsufficient and missense variants have comparable DNA methylation profiles, and cells expressing these PURA variants showed consistent Pur-a downregulation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism. CONCLUSION: Patients with PURA-NDD exhibit a specific episignature, which has potential to aid identification and diagnosis of PURA-NDD patients and offer implications for further functional investigations.

We recently reported an association between an epigenetic biomarker of early-life tobacco smoke exposure at the AHRR gene and increased frequency of somatic gene deletions among ALL cases. METHODS: Here, we further assess this association using two epigenetic biomarkers for maternal smoking during pregnancy-DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and a recently established polyepigenetic smoking score-in an expanded set of 482 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases in the California Childhood Leukemia Study with available Illumina 450K or MethylationEPIC array data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the associations between the epigenetic biomarkers and gene deletion numbers. RESULTS: We found an association between DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion number among 284 childhood B-ALL cases with MethylationEPIC array data, with a ratio of means (RM) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.69] for each 0.1 beta value reduction in DNA methylation, an effect size similar to our previous report in an independent set of 198 B-ALL cases with 450K array data [meta-analysis summary RM (sRM) = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.57]. The polyepigenetic smoking score was positively associated with gene deletion frequency among all 482 B-ALL cases (sRM = 1.31 for each 4-unit increase in score; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence that prenatal tobacco-smoke exposure may influence the generation of somatic copy-number deletions in childhood B-ALL. IMPACT: Analyses of deletion breakpoint sequences are required to further understand the mutagenic effects of tobacco smoke in childhood ALL.

However, the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking on child brain development has yet to be elucidated. Objective: To investigate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring brain development in preadolescence as well as the mediating pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis. Exposures: Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score. Results: The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24701,2022-08-01
